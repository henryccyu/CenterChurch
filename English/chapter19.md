# Chapter 19 THE SEARCH FOR THE MISSIONAL CHURCH

The word missional first became popular after the 1998 publication of the book titled Missional Church and in the years since it has been adopted and used widely.¹ Many are asking, “How
can we really be missional?" An entire generation of younger evangelical leaders has grown up searching for the true missional church as if for the Holy Grail. Seemingly a dozen books come
out each year with the word missional in their title, but a survey of these books reveals that the word has significantly different meanings and is used in different ways by different authors,
organizations, and churches-leading to much confusion about what, exactly, the term missional means.

Before the term missional exploded throughout the Christian world, it was primarily used in mainline Protestant and ecumenical circles in a manner closely associated with the Latin
phrase missio Dei. The phrase was originally coined to convey the teaching of Karl Barth about the action of God in the world. According to Lesslie Newbigin, the term missio Dei became
prominent after the 1952 world mission conference in Willingen, Germany. It was a way of referring to the idea that God is active in the world, working to redeem the entire creation, and that
the church's task is to participate in this mission.2

In his influential 1991 book Transforming Mission, David Bosch explained that the term missio Dei was firmly grounded in Trinitarian theology. Bosch noted that in the past, mission was
largely viewed as a category of soteriology (as a way to save souls) or as a category of ecclesiology (as a way to expand the church). In contrast, the concept of missio Dei implied that mission
should be "understood as being derived from the very nature of God ... put in the context of the doctrine of the Trinity, not of ecclesiology or soteriology."3 The Trinity is, by nature, "sending."
The Father sends the Son into the world to save it, and the Father and the Son send the Spirit into the world. And now, said Bosch, the Spirit is sending the church. In short, God does not merely
send the church in mission. God already is in mission, and the church must join him. This also means, then, that the church does not simply have a missions department; it should wholly
exist to be a mission.

At first glance, this seemed to be a strong and sound theology of mission. As time went on, however, it meant the church actually came to be seen as less relevant. Lesslie Newbigin wrote
these words in the late 1970s:

> If God is indeed the true missionary, it was said, our business is to not promote the mission of the church, but to get out into the world, find out "what God is doing in the world," and join
forces with him. And "what God is doing" was generally thought to be in the secular rather than in the religious sectors of human life. The effect, of course, was to look for what seemed to
be the rising powers and to identify Christians' missionary responsibility with support for a range of political and cultural developments.4

Harvey Cox of Harvard Divinity School wrote, "What God is doing in the world is politics... Theology today must [therefore] be that reflection-in-action by which the church finds out
what this politician-God is up to and moves in to work along with him."5 In many mainline and ecumenical circles, mission came to mean working with secular human rights movements
or rising left-wing political organizations. The results, Newbigin wrote, were "sometimes bizarre indeed. Even Chairman Mao's 'little red book' became almost a new Bible."6 Newbigin, who
was one of the key people involved in the forming of the World Council of Churches, became increasingly concerned that the concept of the missio Dei left little need for the church. The
church could not meet human needs as well as social service agencies could, nor could it change society as well as political parties and organizations could. So in this view, the church became
inconsequential.
