# Chapter 9 BIBLICAL CONTEXTUALIZATION

The Bible has much to say about human culture and how the gospel frames our relationship to it. I'll begin by looking at three key passages that have proved helpful to me in developing a biblical view of contextualization. The first, Romans 1 and 2, provides the basis for contextualization, namely, that the Bible takes a mixed view of culture, and while many elements of a culture can be affirmed, we must avoid uncritically accepting aspects of culture without first examining them in light of the gospel. The second passage, 1 Corinthians 9, speaks to our motive for contextualization, reminding us that we need to be flexible toward culture, ready to adapt what we can to communicate the gospel message. Third, in 1 Corinthians 1, the Bible gives us a basic formula for contextualization and shows us how to keep a balance between affirming and confronting culture.

## RESTRAINING THE POWER OF SIN
An interesting example of common grace can be seen in Isaiah 45:1, where we read about Cyrus, a pagan king whom God anoints with his Spirit and chooses for world leadership. God's use of Cyrus is an example of why common grace is often seen in a culture as a nonsaving, restraining force in the world. By giving people, regardless of what they believe about God, a measure of wisdom, courage, insight, and goodness, the Spirit works to
check the power and influence of sin in the world and keeps it from being as bad a place to live as it could be.

## ROMANS 1-2 AND THE MIXED NATURE OF CULTURE
Every culture is a mixed bag of good and bad elements, and we should avoid rejecting certain aspects of a culture simply because they differ from our own. While this idea seems true at a common-sense level, does the Bible actually give a warrant for it? A study of Romans 1 and 2 suggests it does.

Every culture assumes a set of answers to the big questions: Why are we here? What are therefore the most important things in life? What is wrong with the world? What will put things right? And every society considers something of supreme worth; accordingly, they seek to bring their environment into service to it. No culture is neutral on these matters, and in this sense all cultural work can be said to be "covenantal" - we are all committed to something, even when those presuppositions and assumptions aren't consciously identified. Romans 1 and 2 get this point across by telling us that all have sinned and fall short of God's glory-that both Jews and Gentiles alike are lost. The pagan Gentiles may make
sensuality an idol, but the Jews make moral righteousness an idol-like every culture, they look to something else to justify and save them rather than God.

Yet at the same time we see in Romans 1 and 2 that all human beings possess a primordial knowledge of God. In Romans 2:14-15, Paul states that God's law is written on the heart of every human being. All people have an innate sense of the rightness of honesty, justice, love, and the Golden Rule.¹ Because we are made in the image of God (Gen 1:26-28), all people know at some deep level that there is a God, that we are his creatures, and that we should serve him and areaccountable to him. There is "general revelation" or "common grace" — a nonsaving knowledge and likeness of God that he grants to all those who bear his image-present in some way in every culture. This is not saving knowledge. It does
not tell us about Jesus or what he has done for us, for that can only be known through the "special revelation" of the Bible. But a general understanding of God exists, for God reveals a measure of his truth and wisdom to all.

This is why Isaiah 28:23 - 29 can state that anyone who is skillful in agriculture, who brings forth an advancement in farming science, has been "instructed by God." One commentator writes about this text: "What appears as a discovery (the proper season and conditions for sowing, farm management, rotation of crops, etc.) is actually the Creator opening his book of creation and revealing his truth."2 And farining is just one aspect of human culture. The development of new music, new technologies that advance our ability to travel by air or communicate with others, wise political leadership — all of these things are the result of God's opening his book of creation and teaching us (cf. Exod 31:2-11; Jas 1:17).

Romans 1:18-25 gives a dynamic and balanced picture of how general revelation (or common grace) actually works in people's lives. We read that the truth is being suppressed (v. 18), but it continues to bear down on us. The NIV translates verse 20 as "Since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities... have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so men are without excuse." But the verbs nooumena ("are being understood") and kathoratai ("are being seen") are in the form of present passive participles. In other words, the reality of God's nature and our obligations to him are continuously present to us. General revelation is not just a set of innate ideas or static principles. It is the continuous and insistent pressure of God's truth on the consciousness of every human being.

Every human culture is an extremely complex mixture of brilliant truth, marred half-truths, and overt resistance to the truth. Every culture will have some idolatrous discourse within it. And yet every culture will have some witness to God's truth in it. God gives out good gifts of wisdom, talent, beauty, and skill completely without regard for merit. He casts them across a culture like seed, in order to enrich, brighten, and preserve the world. Without this understanding of culture, Christians will tend to think that they can live self-sufficiently, isolated from and unblessed by the contributions of those in the world. Without an appreciation for God's gracious display of his wisdom in the broader culture, Christians may struggle to understand why non-Christians often exceed Christians in moral practice, wisdom, and skill. The doctrine of sin means that as believers we are never as good as our right worldview should make us. At the same time, the doctrine of our creation in the image of God, and an understanding of common grace, remind us that nonbelievers are never as flawed as their false worldview should make them.

This suggests that our stance toward every human culture should be one of critical enjoyment and an appropriate wariness. Yes, we should enjoy the insights and the creativity of other peoples and cultures. We should recognize and celebrate expressions of justice, wisdom, truth, and beauty in every culture. But we approach every culture with awareness that it has been distorted by sin and in particular, the sin of idolatry. All cultures contain elements of darkness and light. We can't simplistically conclude that traditional, conservative cultures are biblical and that liberal, secular cultures are immoral and evil. Traditional cultures have their own idols, often elevating the family or ethnicity to an absolute value-leading to the evils of racism, tribalism, patriarchy and other forms of moralism and oppression. Liberal cultures elevate the individual and the principle of human freedom to an absolute value-leading to the erosion of family, community, of integrity in both business and sexual practices. Yet both the importance of the family and the worth and freedom of the individual are to be found at the center of a biblical worldview. A coherent and biblical understanding of
