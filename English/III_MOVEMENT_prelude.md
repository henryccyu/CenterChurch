A Center Church is both an organism and an organization. Because the church is both a stable institution with inherited traditions and a dynamic movement of the Holy Spirit, we minister
with balance, rooted in our ecclesial tradition yet working cooperatively with the body of Christ to reach our city with the gospel.

MOVEMENT
Our goal as Christians and Christian ministers is never simply to build our own tribe. Instead, we seek the peace and prosperity of the city or community in which we are placed, through a gospel movement led by the Holy Spirit. Movements like these do not follow a "bounded-set" approach in
which you only work with others who can sign off on nearly all your distinctive beliefs and practices. Rather it follows a "centered-set" orientation in which you work most closely with those who face with you toward the same center. That center is a classic, orthodox understanding of the gospel
of Jesus Christ, a common mission to reach and serve your city, and a commitment to have a generous, Christ-focused posture toward people who disagree with you. It's a type of movement that is missional, integrative, and dynamic.
There is an ongoing conversation today about the nature of the church's mission and its relationship to the work of individual Christians in the world. In part 6, Missional Community, we look at the history of the discussion, outline what it looks like to be a missional church today, offer some
words of caution about the missional conversation, and suggest how churches can practically equip their people in missional living.
In part 7, we examine what it means to have an Integrative Ministry.
This requires applying a Center Church theological vision to four "ministry fronts." Churches must first seek to connect people to God through evangelism and worship. Second, an integrated church will work to connect people to one another through community and discipleship. The church should
also seek ways of connecting people to the needs of the city through mercy and justice ministries. Finally, churches must help connect people to the culture through the integration of faith and work.
In part 8, we conclude by discussing what it means to develop Movement Dynamics in your church and throughout the city. To faithfully connect the gospel with the culture we will need to develop intentional movements of churches planting new churches that faithfully proclaim God's truth
and serve their communities.
