# Chapter 5 THE ESSENCE OF GOSPEL RENEWAL
Revival is necessary because religion ("I obey; therefore I am accepted") is so different from the gospel ("I am accepted by God through Christ; therefore I obey") but is such an effective counterfeit. Though these systems of motivation and purpose have utterly different lineages, on the surface they may look like twins. Two people basing their lives on these two systems may sit right beside each other in church.
Both strive to obey the law of God, to pray, to give generously, and to be good family members. Yet they do so out of radically different motives, in radically different spirits, and resulting in radically different kinds of inner personal character. One of them (the "religious" one) may even be lost altogether. Even the one operating out of the gospel will naturally drift into religion unless constantly challenged and renewed.
If these insights from the last chapter addressed the why of gospel renewal, the question for this chapter is the what of gospel renewal. What does the gospel do that actually changes people in a congregation? How can the distinct and unique theological truths of the gospel be formulated in ways that produce new, Spirit-led, Christ-centered motivation in people, whether their starting point is religion
or irreligion? First we will look further at the distinction between religion, irreligion, and the gospel. Then we will see how these insights are applied to the heart.

### THREE WAYS OF RESPONDING TO GOD
Christians typically identify two ways to respond to God: follow him and do his will, or reject him and do your own thing. Ultimately this is true, but there are actually two ways to reject God that must be distinguished from one another. You can reject God by rejecting his law and living any way you see fit. And you can also reject God by embracing and obeying God's law so as to earn your salvation. The problem is
that people in this last group - who reject the gospel in favor of moralism-look as if they are trying to do God's will. Consequently, there are not just two ways to respond to God but three: irreligion, religion, and the gospel.

Irreligion is avoiding God as Lord and Savior by ignoring him altogether. "Religion," or moralism, is avoiding God as Lord and Savior by developing a moral righteousness and then presenting it to God in an effort to show that he "owes" you.1 The gospel, however, has nothing to do with our developing a righteousness we give God so he owes us; it is God's developing and giving us righteousness through
Jesus Christ (1 Cor 1:30; 2 Cor 5:21). The gospel differs from both religion and irreligion, from both moralism and relativism.

This theme runs the length of the Bible. When God saves the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, he first leads them out and then gives them the law to obey. Law obedience is the result of their deliverance and election, not the cause of it (Exod 19:4-5; Deut 7:6-9). As God makes a covenant with the Israelites, he warns them that it is still possible for them to be uncircumcised in heart (Lev 26:41; Deut 10:16;
30:6; Jer 4:4)â€”even as they are completely compliant and obedient to all the laws, observances, and rituals of worship. As we saw in the previous chapter, it took the New Testament to lay out what it meant to be the true circumcision (Phil 3:3). Paul tells us that the circumcised in heart do not rely on their law keeping for confidence before God. Paul explains the three ways to live according to the Old Testament: (1)
literally uncircumcised (pagans and nonbelievers who do not submit to God's laws); (2) circumcised only in the flesh (submitted to God's law but resting and relying on it); and (3) circumcised in heart (submitted to God's law in response to the saving grace of God).

In the New Testament, these three ways appear most prominently in Romans 1-4. Beginning in Romans 1:18-32, Paul shows how the pagan, immoral Gentiles are lost and alienated from God. In Romans 2:1-3:20, Paul counterintuitively states that the moral, Bible-believing Jews are lost and alienated from God as well. "What shall we conclude then? Are we any better? Not at all! We have already made
the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin. As it is written: 'There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one... who seeks God' "(Rom 3:9-11). The last part of this statement is particularly shocking, since Paul concludes that thousands of men and women who were diligently obeying and believing the Bible were not seeking God, even in all their religion. The reason is that if you seek to be right
with God through your morality and religion, you are not seeking God for your salvation; you are using God as a means to achieve your own salvation. Paul proceeds in the rest of Romans to explain the gospel as seeking God in Christ for salvation through grace alone and through faith alone.

Throughout the Gospels, these three ways-religion, irreligion, and the gospel - are repeatedly depicted in Jesus' encounters. Whether a Pharisee or a tax collector (Luke 18), a Pharisee or a fallen woman (Luke 7), or a respectable crowd and a man possessed by a demon (Mark 5), in every instance the less moral, less religious person connects more readily to Jesus. Even in John 3 and 4, where a similar
contrast occurs between a Pharisee and an immoral Samaritan woman, the woman receives the gospel with joy, while Nicodemus the Pharisee evidently has to go home and think about it. Here we have the New Testament version of what we saw in earlier pages of the Bible - that God chooses the foolish things to shame the wise, the weak things to shame the strong, to show that his salvation is by grace (see 1 Cor
1:26-31).

It is so much easier to move from the gospel to religion than the other way round. One of Martin Luther's fundamental insights is that religion is the default mode of the human heart. Even irreligious people earn their acceptability and sense of worth by living up to their set of values.2 And the effects of "works-religion" persist so stubbornly in the heart that Christians who believe the gospel at one level
will continually revert to religion, operating at deeper levels as if they are saved by their works. Richard F. Lovelace develops this train of thought:

Only a fraction of the present body of professing Christians are solidly appropriating the justifying work of Christ in their lives. Many... have a theoretical commitment to this doctrine, but in their day-to-day existence they rely on their sanctification for justification... drawing their assurance of acceptance with God from their sincerity, their past experience of conversion, their recent religious performance or
the relative infrequency of their conscious, willful disobedience. Few know enough to start each day with a thoroughgoing stand upon Luther's platform: you are accepted, looking outward in faith and claiming the wholly alien righteousness of Christ as the only ground for acceptance, relaxing in that quality of trust which will produce increasing sanctification as faith is active in love and gratitude...
> Much that we have interpreted as a defect of sanctification in church people is really an outgrowth of their loss of bearing with respect to justification. Christians who are no longer sure that God loves and accepts them in Jesus, apart from their present spiritual achievements, are subconsciously radically insecure persons... Their insecurity shows itself in pride, a fierce defensive assertion of their
own righteousness and defensive criticism of others. They come naturally to hate other cultural styles and other races in order to bolster their own security and discharge their suppressed anger.3

### PREACHING THE THIRD WAY FOR EVERYONE
**A QUICK COMPARISON OF RELIGION AND THE GOSPEL<sup>4</sup>**  
| RELIGION | GOSPEL |
|---|---|
| "I obey; therefore I'm accepted." |"I'm accepted; therefore I obey." |
| Motivation is based on fear and insecurity. | Motivation is based on grateful joy. |
| I obey God in order to get things from God. | I obey God to get God-to delight and resemble him. |
| When circumstances in my life go wrong, I am angry at God or myself, since I believe, like Job's friends, that anyone who is good deserves a comfortable life. | When circumstances in my life go wrong, I struggle, but I know that while God may allow this for my training, he will exercise his fatherly love within my trial. |
| When I am criticized, I am furious or devastated because it is essential for me to think of myself as a "good person." Threats to that self-image must be destroyed at all costs. | When I am criticized, I struggle, but it is not essential for me to think of myself as a "good person." My identity is not built on my performance but on God's love for me in Christ. |
| My prayer life consists largely of petition and only heats up when I am in need. My main purpose in prayer is to control circumstances. | My prayer life consists of generous stretches of praise and adoration. My main purpose is fellowship with him. |
