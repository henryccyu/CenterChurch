Chapter 14
THE GOSPEL FOR THE CITY

I have made as strenuous a case as I can that the city is one of the highest priorities for Christian life and mission in the twenty-first century. Now I want to press even further. These chapters
on City Vision may have given you the idea that I think all Christians should move into cities and serve there. To be clear, this is not what I am saying. I believe there must be Christians and
churches everywhere there are people. In one sense, there are no "little" places or people.¹ God loves to use unimportant people (1 Cor 1:26-31) and unlikely places (John 1:46) to do his work.
Jesus wasn't from Rome or even Jerusalem but was born in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth—perhaps to make this very point. We have been told that now something like 50 percent of the
world's population live in cities — but this means that half the population does not live in urban areas, and therefore we must not discourage or devalue gospel ministry in the hundreds of
thousands of towns and villages on earth. And ministry in small towns may not change a country, but it surely can have a major impact in its region.2

And yet a thought experiment may be illuminating here. Imagine you are in charge of establishing new churches in two different towns - one has a hundred residents, while the other
has ten thousand residents. Imagine also that you have only four church planters. Where would you send them? Regardless of philosophy, I doubt anyone would send two church planters
to each town on the premise that all places are equally important in ministry. It simply would not be good stewardship of God's human resources to send two pastors to a town with only a
hundred residents. It is good stewardship, though, to insist that we should increase our attention and emphasis on urban ministry in a day when nonurban areas typically have more churches
than cities and when cities are increasingly exerting more influence on how human life is lived in the world.

So I am not saying that all Christians should pack up and go to live and minister in urban areas. What I am saying is that the cities of the world are grievously underserved by the church
because, in general, the people of the world are moving into cities faster than churches are. And I am seeking to use all the biblical, sociological, missiological, ecclesial, and rhetorical resources
at my disposal to help the church (particularly in the United States) reorient itself to address this deficit.

But the call to the city doesn't end there. Everywhere in the world is more urban than it was ten or twenty years ago. Wherever you live, work, and serve, the city is coming to you. In
a sense, every church can and must become a church for its particular city - whether that city is a great metropolis, a university town, or a village. As a result, I believe you can benefit by
allowing yourself and your ministry to be intentionally shaped by the realities and patterns of urban life and culture. In order to accomplish this, we must look first at how the dynamics of the
city affect our lives and then consider how churches with City Vision will minister in response to these dynamics.

## HOW THE CITY WORKS ON US
By many people's reckoning, the "death of distance" should have led to a decline in cities, but it has not. If you can learn things over the Internet, the thinking went, why pay big-city prices for
housing? But real learning, communication, and community are far more complex than we may care to acknowledge. A great deal of research has shown that face-to-face contact and learning
can never be fully replaced by any other kind.

It is no surprise, then, that research shows us that productivity is significantly higher for companies that locate near the geographic center of "inventive activity" in their industry. Why?
Proximity to others working in your field enables the infinite number of interactions, many of them informal, that turns neophytes into experts more quickly and helps experts stimulate each
other to new insights. Edward Glaeser observes, "Much of the value of a dense work environment comes from unplanned meetings and observing the random doings of the people around you.
Video conferencing will never give a promising young worker the ability to learn by observing the day-to-day operations of a successful mentor."3 Other studies reveal that a high percentage
of patent applications cited older patents in the same metropolitan region, so "even in our age of information technology, ideas are often geographically localized."4

Urban theorists call this "agglomeration." Agglomeration refers to the economic and social benefits of physically locating near one another. It is not surprising, then, that more movies
are produced in Los Angeles and Toronto than in Atlanta, because those cities have far larger pools of skilled laborers — writers, directors, actors, technicians — who can make movies happen.
It is not surprising that new innovations in financial services come out of Manhattan or new technologies out of Silicon Valley. Why? Agglomeration. The physical clustering of thousands of
people who work in the same field naturally generates new ideas and enterprises. But the benefits of agglomeration are not limited to locating near people who, like you, work in the same field.
There are benefits to be reaped of living near large groups of people who are unlike you but who have skills that supplement yours.

A good case study is the world of the arts. "Artistic movements are often highly localized," even more so than in other fields. Urban scholar Elizabeth Currid interviewed New York City
cultural producers (fashion designers, musicians, and fine artists) and gatekeepers (gallery owners, curators, and editors), as well as owners of clubs and venues frequented by these groups,
people in the media and sometimes the academy, the directors of foundations that supported the arts, and prosperous businessmen and women who often acted as patrons.7 Art "happened"
when complex interactions occurred among people in these diverse sectors of the arts ecosystem - not typically through business meetings in workplaces but through interactions at social
gatherings and spontaneous meetings in informal situations. Currid found that the cultural economy depends on having "artistic and cultural producers densely agglomerated," part of a
"clustered production system." When these various classes of persons live in geographical proximity, thousands of enterprise-producing, culture-making, face-to-face interactions take place
that could not take place otherwise.2 As Ryan Avent puts it, "Cities are a lot like a good group of friends: what you're doing isn't nearly as important as the fact that you're doing it together."10

How do the dynamics of agglomeration bear on the real life of the average city Christian? First, the city uniquely links you with many people like you. The city's challenges and opportunities
attract the most talented, ambitious, and restless. So whoever you are, in the city you will encounter people who are far more talented and advanced than you are. Because you are placed among
so many like-but-extremely-skilled people in your field, you will be consistently challenged to reach down and do your very best. You feel driven and pressed by the intensity of the place to
realize every ounce of your potential. Cities draw and gather together human resources, tapping their potential for cultural development as no other human-life structure can. But sin takes
this strength feature of the city - its culture-forming intensity — and turns it into a place tainted by deadly hubris, envy, and burnout. This is what sin does. It is a parasitic perversion of the
good. The gospel is needed to resist the dark side of this gift.

> **FACE-TO-FACE**  
> Two researchers at the University of Michigan gave groups of six students each the rules of a game to play as a team. Some groups were allowed ten minutes of face-to-face interaction to discuss strategy before playing. Other groups were given thirty minutes of electronic interaction before playing the game in the exact same way. The groups that only met electronically before the game did far less well. This and other experiments have helped us to see that "face-to face contact leads to more trust, generosity, and cooperation than any other sort of interaction."11 Indeed, common sense tells us that we work up to the level of those working around us.

Second, the city uniquely links you with many people unlike you. The city attracts society's subcultures and minorities, who can band together for mutual support. It is inherently merciful to those with less power, creating safe enclaves for singles, the poor, immigrants, and racial minorities. Because you are placed among such inescapable diversity, you will be consistently challenged in your views and beliefs. You will be confronted with creative, new approaches to thought and practice and must either abandon your traditional ways and beliefs or become far more knowledgeable about and committed to them than you were before. Again, sin takes a strength feature of the city - its culture-forming diversity — and turns it into a place that undermines our prior commitments and worldviews. And again, the gospel is needed to resist the dark side of this gift.

How should Christians respond to these ways that the city challenges us? We must respond with the gospel. And how, exactly, does the gospel help us face these challenges with joy rather
than fear? Obviously, it is true that we must bring the gospel to the city and hear the gospel while in the city. But we must also recognize how much the city itself brings the gospel to us. The
city will challenge us to discover the power of the gospel in new ways. We will find people who seem spiritually and morally hopeless to us. We will think, "Those people will never believe in
Christ." But a comment such as this is revealing in itself. If salvation is truly by grace, not by virtue and merit, why should we think that anyone is less likely than ourselves to be a Christian?
Why would anyone's conversion be any greater miracle than our own? The city may force us to discover that we don't really believe in sheer grace, that we really believe God mainly saves nice
people - people like us.

In cities we will also meet a lot of people who hold to other religions or to no religion who are wiser, kinder, and more thoughtful than we are, because even after growth in grace, many
Christians are weaker people than many non-Christians. When this surprises you, reflect on it. If the gospel of grace is true, why would we think that Christians are a better kind of person
than non-Christians? These living examples of common grace may begin to show us that even though we intellectually understand the doctrine of justification by faith alone, functionally we
continue to assume that salvation is by moral goodness and works.

Early in Redeemer's ministry, we discovered it was misguided for Christians to feel pity for the city, and it was harmful to think of ourselves as its "savior." We had to humbly learn from
and respect our city and its people. Our relationship with them had to be a consciously reciprocal one. We had to be willing to see God's common grace in their lives. We had to learn that we
needed them to fill out our own understanding of God and his grace, just as they needed us.

I believe many Christians in the West avoid the city because it is filled with "the other." Because cities are filled with people who are completely unlike us, many Christians find this
disorienting. Deep down, we know we don't like these people or don't feel safe around them. But see how easily we forget the gospel! After all, in the gospel we learn of a God who came and
lived among us, became one of us, and loved us to the death, even though we were wholly other from him. The city humbles us, showing us how little we are actually shaped by the story and
pattern of the gospel.

The gospel alone can give us the humility ("I have much to learn from the city"), the confidence ("I have much to give to the city"), and the courage ("I have nothing to fear from the city")
to do effective ministry that honors God and blesses others. And in time we will see that, for our own continuing spiritual growth and well-being, we need the city perhaps more than the city
needs us.

## WHAT SHOULD CHRISTIANS DO ABOUT CITIES?
If this is how the city can change us for the better, what can we do to return the favor?  
1. **Christians should develop appreciative attitudes toward the city**. In obedience to God, Jonah went to the city of Nineveh, but he didn't love it. In the same way, Christians may
come to the city out of a sense of duty to God while being filled with great disdain for the density and diversity of the city. But for ministry in cities to be effective, it is critical that Christians
appreciate cities. They should love city life and find it energizing. 12 Why is this so important?  
First, because so many who live in and have influence in the city do actually enjoy living there. If you try to draw them into your church, they will quickly pick up on your negative attitude,
which can erect a barrier in their willingness to listen to the gospel. Second, if a church consists primarily of people who dislike urban living, those people won't be staying very long. Your
church will be plagued with huge turnover (as if turnover and transience aren't enough of a problem already in the city!).  
Preaching and teaching that produce a city-positive church must constantly address the common objections to city living, which include beliefs that city life is "less healthy," too
expensive, and an inferior place to raise families. Two additional objections are especially prevalent. One objection I commonly hear is this: "The country is wholesome; the city is corrupting."
Christians should be able to recognize the bad theology (as well as bad history) behind this idea. Liberal humanism of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries viewed human nature as
intrinsically good and virtuous, so they concluded that human problems came from wrong socialization. In other words, we become violent and antisocial because of our environment. They
taught that human society-especially urban society-teaches us to be selfish and violent. As we have seen, however, the Bible teaches that the city is simply a magnifying glass for the human
heart. It brings out whatever is already inside. In the previous chapter, we examined the city's strengths for culture making, as well as its spiritual dangers. But we must remember that the city
itself is not to blame for the evil that humans have sinfully brought into it.  
Here is another common objection: "The country inspires; faith dies in the city." While the countryside can indeed inspire, it is quite wrong to say that the urban environment is a harder
environment to find and grow in faith. As we noted earlier, many people coming from regions where Christianity is suppressed by the culture hear the gospel for the first time in the great cities
where there is more of a "free market" of ideas. Millions of people who are virtually cut off from gospel witness are reachable if they emigrate to cities. Also, many who were raised as nominal
Christians come to the cities where they are challenged in new ways and brought to vital, solid faith in the process. I have seen this occur thousands of times during my ministry at Redeemer.
The city is, in fact, a spiritual hotbed where people both lose faith and find it in ways that do not happen in more monolithic, less pluralistic settings. This is, yet again, part of the tension of the
city we see addressed in the Bible (see chapter 11).  
Sometimes the contrast of the countryside and the city is drawn even more starkly. My colleague at Westminster, Harvie Conn, told me about a man who said to him, "God made the
country, and man built the suburbs, but the devil made the city." The theology behind this statement is dubious to say the least. And theologically, it is not a good idea to think of the
countryside as intrinsically more pleasing to God. An urban missionary, Bill Krispin, explains why. Bill once said to me, "The country is where there are more plants than people; the city is
where there are more people than plants. And since God loves people much more than plants, he loves the city more than the country." I think this is solid theological logic. The apex of creation
is, after all, the making of male and female in the image of God (Gen 1:26-27). Therefore, cities, which are filled with people, are absolutely crammed full of what God considers the most
beautiful sight in his creation. As we have noted before, cities have more "image of God" per square inch than anywhere else, and so we must not idealize the country as somehow a more
spiritual place than the city. Even those (like Wendell Berry) who lift up the virtues of rural living outline a form of human community just as achievable in cities as in small towns.  
> **WENDELL BERRY AND THE "AGRARIAN MIND"**  
> Many people point to the essayist Wendell Berry as a leading light of modern agrarians who seem to make a strong case for rural living over urban living. However, while Berry
does laud the life of the farm and the small town, he defines the "agrarian mind" as essentially that which values the local:  
    The agrarian mind is... local. It must know on intimate terms the local plants and animals and local soils; it must know local possibilities and impossibilities,
opportunities and hazards. It depends and insists on knowing very particular local histories and biographies.13  
He goes on to speak of the agrarian mind as (1) valuing work not for the money it can command but for what it provides for human flourishing; (2) valuing work that
makes things that are concrete, durable, and useful; (3) embracing humility and having little need for growth and wealth; and (4) holding a commitment to a particular place
for a lifetime and to conducting one's work, recreation, family life in the same place and within a web of thick, long-term, local personal relationships. Berry contrasts this with
an "industrial mind" characterized by pride and a lack of respect and gratitude for nature and limitations and manifesting itself in exploitation and greed.  
What this means, I believe, is that a person with an "agrarian" mind can live in a city very well. It is illuminating to compare the seminal work of Jane Jacobs (The Death
and Life of the Great American Cities) with Berry's work. Jacobs was as committed as Berry to the importance of neighborhood — of local economies in which members of the
neighborhood knew each other, had regular dealings with each other, and identified their own interests with the interests of their neighbors.

How can you as a church or an individual live out this value if you are not located near a metropolitan area? I believe the best strategy is to include urban ministry in your global missions
portfolio. This may mean supporting individual missionaries who serve in cities; an even more effective strategy is to support church-planting ministries in global cities. 15 Another promising
trend is the creation of metro-wide partnerships of churches and other agencies to support the holistic work of spreading the gospel throughout the city. 

2. Christians should become a dynamic counterculture where they live. It will not be enough for Christians to simply live as individuals in the city, however. They must live as a
particular kind of community. In the Bible's tale of two cities, man's city is built on the principle of personal aggrandizement (Gen 11:1 - 4), while "the city of our God... is beautiful in its
loftiness, the joy of the whole earth" (Ps 48:1-2). In other words, the urban society God wants is based on service, not selfishness. Its purpose is to spread joy from its cultural riches to the
whole world. Christians are called to be an alternate city within every earthly city, an alternate human culture within every human culture-to show how sex, money, and power can be used in
nondestructive ways; to show how classes and races that cannot get along outside of Christ can get along in him; and to show how it is possible to cultivate by using the tools of art, education,
government, and business to bring hope to people rather than despair or cynicism.  
Someone may ask, "Can't Christians be an alternate city out in the suburbs?" Absolutely! This is one of our universal callings as Christians. Yet again, though, the earthly city magnifies
the effect of this alternate city and its unique forms of ministry. In racially homogeneous places, it is harder to show in pragmatic ways how the gospel uniquely undermines racial barriers (see
Eph 2:11-22). In places where few artists live, it is pragmatically harder to show the gospel's unique effect on art. In economically homogeneous places, physically removed from the human
poverty that is so pervasive in the world, it is pragmatically harder for Christians to realize how much money they are spending on themselves. What is possible in the suburbs and rural towns
comes into sharper focus in the city. The city illustrates in vivid detail the unique community life that is produced as the fruit of the gospel.

3. Christians should be a community radically committed to the good of their city as a whole. It is not enough for Christians to form a culture that merely "counters" the values of the
city. We must also commit, with all the resources of our faith and life, to serve sacrificially the good of the whole city, and especially the poor.  
It is especially important that Christians not be seduced by the mind-set of the "consumer city" — the city as adult playground. Cities attract young adults with a dizzying variety of
amenities and diversions that no suburb or small town can reproduce. Even when holding constant factors such as income, education, marital status, and age, city residents are far more likely
to go to a concert, visit a museum, go to the movies, or stop into a local pub than people outside of urban areas.16 On top of this, urban residents, more than their country cousins, tend to take
an unmistakable pride in sophistication and hipness. Christians must not be tempted to come to the city (or at least not to remain in the city) for these motivations. Christians indeed can be
enriched by the particular joys of urban life, but ultimately they live in cities to serve.
> Jacobs called this "eyes on the street"- people who felt ownership of the environment, were committed to the common welfare, and watched the street, willing to take action
if necessary. Both urban neighborhoods and small towns have mixed-land use in which residences, shops, businesses, schools, and so forth were all within walking distance
of each other, which leads to more human-scale, local economy.  
Jacobs's book was a polemic against the "suburbanization" of the city occurring in the 1960s by planners who were destroying local neighborhoods in order to build large-scale,
homogeneous areas of retail, business offices, or residences. The New Urbanism today revels in the very small-scale, walkable, mixed-use communities that Jacobs describes.
Political theorist Mark Mitchell writes these interesting words:  
    Ultimately, healthy communities will only be realized when individuals commit to a particular place and to particular neighbors in the long-term work of making
a place, of recognizing and enjoying the responsibilities and pleasures of membership in a local community. These good things are not the unique provenance of
agrarian or rural settings. They can and have been achieved in urban and town settings. 14
Christians must work for the peace, security, justice, and prosperity of their neighbors, loving them in word and deed, whether or not they believe the same things we believe. In Jeremiah
29:7, God calls the Jews not just to live in the city but to love it and work for its shalom - its economic, social, and spiritual flourishing. Christians are, indeed, citizens of God's heavenly city,
but these citizens are always the best possible citizens of their earthly city. They walk in the steps of the One who laid down his life for his opponents.
Christians in cities must become a counterculture for the common good. They must be radically different from the surrounding city, yet radically committed to its benefit. They must
minister to the city out of their distinctive Christian beliefs and identity. We see this balance demonstrated when we examine the early Christian understanding of citizenship. Paul used his
Roman citizenship as leverage and defense in the service of his wider missional aims (Acts 16:37-38; 22:25-29; cf. 21:39; 23:27). He tells the Ephesians that because of the work of the gospel,
"You are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as
the chief cornerstone" (Eph 2:19-20, emphasis mine).
And to the church in Philippi, Paul writes, "Our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring
everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body" (Phil 3:20-21). Though Roman citizenship was a beneficial badge and indeed carried
valuable social status, Paul is clear that Christians are, first and foremost, citizens of heaven.
Joseph presents an interesting Old Testament demonstration of this tension. When he is made prince of the land (Gen 41:39-40), he pursues the wealth and good of Egypt, just as he had
previously done in prison and in Potiphar's house. Through his pursuit of the good of the city, salvation comes to the people of God. This story is especially striking because God puts Joseph in
the position to save the city from hunger, not just the people of God.
In the end, Christians live not to increase the prosperity of our own tribe and group through power plays and coercion but to serve the good of all the people of the city (regardless of
what beliefs others hold). While secularism tends to make people individualistic, and traditional religiosity tends to make people tribal, the gospel should destroy the natural selfishness of the
human heart and lead Christians to sacrificial service that benefits the whole city. If Christians seek power and influence, they will arouse fear and hostility. If instead they pursue love and seek
to serve, they will be granted a great deal of influence by their neighbors, a free gift given to trusted and trustworthy people.
