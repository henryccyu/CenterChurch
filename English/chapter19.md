# Chapter 19 THE SEARCH FOR THE MISSIONAL CHURCH

The word missional first became popular after the 1998 publication of the book titled Missional Church and in the years since it has been adopted and used widely.¹ Many are asking, “How
can we really be missional?" An entire generation of younger evangelical leaders has grown up searching for the true missional church as if for the Holy Grail. Seemingly a dozen books come
out each year with the word missional in their title, but a survey of these books reveals that the word has significantly different meanings and is used in different ways by different authors,
organizations, and churches-leading to much confusion about what, exactly, the term missional means.

Before the term missional exploded throughout the Christian world, it was primarily used in mainline Protestant and ecumenical circles in a manner closely associated with the Latin
phrase missio Dei. The phrase was originally coined to convey the teaching of Karl Barth about the action of God in the world. According to Lesslie Newbigin, the term missio Dei became
prominent after the 1952 world mission conference in Willingen, Germany. It was a way of referring to the idea that God is active in the world, working to redeem the entire creation, and that
the church's task is to participate in this mission.2

In his influential 1991 book Transforming Mission, David Bosch explained that the term missio Dei was firmly grounded in Trinitarian theology. Bosch noted that in the past, mission was
largely viewed as a category of soteriology (as a way to save souls) or as a category of ecclesiology (as a way to expand the church). In contrast, the concept of missio Dei implied that mission
should be "understood as being derived from the very nature of God ... put in the context of the doctrine of the Trinity, not of ecclesiology or soteriology."3 The Trinity is, by nature, "sending."
The Father sends the Son into the world to save it, and the Father and the Son send the Spirit into the world. And now, said Bosch, the Spirit is sending the church. In short, God does not merely
send the church in mission. God already is in mission, and the church must join him. This also means, then, that the church does not simply have a missions department; it should wholly
exist to be a mission.

At first glance, this seemed to be a strong and sound theology of mission. As time went on, however, it meant the church actually came to be seen as less relevant. Lesslie Newbigin wrote
these words in the late 1970s:

> If God is indeed the true missionary, it was said, our business is to not promote the mission of the church, but to get out into the world, find out "what God is doing in the world," and join
forces with him. And "what God is doing" was generally thought to be in the secular rather than in the religious sectors of human life. The effect, of course, was to look for what seemed to
be the rising powers and to identify Christians' missionary responsibility with support for a range of political and cultural developments.4

Harvey Cox of Harvard Divinity School wrote, "What God is doing in the world is politics... Theology today must [therefore] be that reflection-in-action by which the church finds out
what this politician-God is up to and moves in to work along with him."5 In many mainline and ecumenical circles, mission came to mean working with secular human rights movements
or rising left-wing political organizations. The results, Newbigin wrote, were "sometimes bizarre indeed. Even Chairman Mao's 'little red book' became almost a new Bible."6 Newbigin, who
was one of the key people involved in the forming of the World Council of Churches, became increasingly concerned that the concept of the missio Dei left little need for the church. The
church could not meet human needs as well as social service agencies could, nor could it change society as well as political parties and organizations could. So in this view, the church became
inconsequential.

> **NEWBIGIN AND THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES**
> Though many evangelicals have appropriated his ideas, Lesslie Newbigin himself never claimed to be an evangelical. He openly repudiated the evangelical doctrine of
Scripture and held to the Barthian idea that God's sovereign election of people was not to salvation but only to service. Newbigin, at a number of places in his writing, seems
to veer close to universalism.
>
> Nevertheless, as time went on, he became more and more critical of the liberal theology of the WCC. Originally, the WCC was committed to a "Christo-centric universalism";
that is, the denominations of the WCC put all other doctrinal differences aside except their common commitment to Christ in order to make the unity of the church
prominently visible as part of its mission to the world. After the appointment in 1992 of Konrad Raiser as general secretary of the WCC, the organization moved to a new
position in which the only necessary basis for solidarity in mission was commitment to the transformation of society for justice and peace. Raiser defended his approach in
Ecumenism in Transition: A Paradigm Shift for the Ecumenical Movement? Raiser's approach essentially left Christ out of the Trinity. He argued that the Father's will was for
justice, peace, and the restoration of creation, and he sent his Spirit out into the world to accomplish this in all sorts of ways, many or most of them having nothing to do with
Christianity or the church.
>
> This was the very thing Newbigin had criticized in The Open Secret. Newbigin wrote a scathing review of Raiser's book in which he argued that Christ and his atoning death
are central to Christian mission, and that, though "I do not want to endorse all that is done by the churches and movements that bear the name 'evangelical'... it is a very
important fact that these bodies are the ones that are growing and showing increasing breadth of vision in their approach to the whole range of contemporary human
problems, while the bodies that hold the doctrinal position represented in this book are largely in decline."8

In The Open Secret, Newbigin criticized what he called the "secularization" of mission. He argued that conversions, the growth of the church, and the quality of Christian community
were all critical and central to mission. Newbigin looked with favor on the theories of missiologist Donald McGavran, who taught that the purpose of mission was "church growth" in quality
and quantity. Nevertheless, Newbigin retained the term missio Dei and its original theological concept of a missionary God. He insisted that the church needed to grow through evangelism
yet be involved in service and in the struggle for justice in the world as well. Newbigin sought to uphold the basic idea of the missio Dei, but he tried to save it from the excesses and distortions
of the ecumenical movement.

## THE NEWBIGIN-BOSCH RESCUE
Lesslie Newbigin had been a British missionary in India for several decades. When he returned to England in the mid-1970s, he saw the massive decline of the church and Christian influence
that had occurred in his absence. At the time he left England, Western society's main cultural institutions still Christianized people, and the churches were easily gathering those who came
to their doors through social expectation and custom. Churches in the West had always supported "missions" in overseas non-Christian cultures (such as India). There on the "mission field,"
churches functioned in a different way than they did in Europe and North America. Churches in India did not merely support missions or even do missions - they were missional in every
aspect. They could not simply process Christianized people as churches did in the West. Rather, every aspect of their church life-worship, preaching, community life, and discipleship - had
to be a form of mission.

For example, on the mission field, visitors to a worship service could not be expected to have any familiarity with Christianity. Therefore the worship and preaching had to address them
in ways both comprehensible and challenging. On the mission field, believers lived in a society with radically different values from those they were taught in church. This made "life in the
world" very complicated for Christians. Discipleship and training had to equip believers to answer many hostile questions from their neighbors. It also had to spell out Christian personal and
corporate behavior patterns that distinguished them and showed society what the kingdom of God was all about. In other words, away from the West, churches did not simply have a missions
department; Christians were "in mission" in every aspect of their public and private lives.

When he returned to England, Newbigin discovered that the ground had shifted. The cultural institutions of society were now indifferent or overtly hostile to Christian faith, and the
number of people who went to church had plummeted. Western culture was fast becoming a non-Christian society — a “mission field” — but the churches were making little adjustment. While many Christian leaders were bemoaning the cultural changes, Western churches continued to minister as before — creating an environment in which only traditional and conservative
people would feel comfortable. They continued to disciple people by focusing on individual skills for their private lives (Bible study and prayer) but failed to train them to live distinctively
Christian lives in a secular world — in the public arenas of politics, art, and business. All they preached and practiced assumed they were still in the Christian West, but the Christian West
was vanishing.

This was a disastrous tactic. Western churches, Newbigin argued, had to put the same kind of thought and effort into reaching their alien, non-Christian culture as the churches in India,
China, and the rest of the world did. Over the last twenty-four years of his life, Newbigin argued tirelessly and trenchantly that the church had to come to grips with the fact that it was no
longer functioning in "Christendom." Rejecting the common view that the West was becoming a secular society without God, Newbigin viewed it as a pagan society filled with idols and false
gods. 2 He especially criticized the ideology of the European Enlightenment and its idolatrous commitment to the autonomy of human reason that had led to the illusion of neutral, value-free,
objective knowledge. This commitment to reason had seduced Western cultural leaders into believing we did not need God or any particular religious faith in order to have a well-ordered, just,
and moral society. Critical to the church's mission in the West, he said, was the unmasking of this false god by showing the futility of the "Enlightenment project" - the fruitless effort to find
consensus on morality, right and wrong, justice, and human flourishing on the basis of secular reason.

In his books The Open Secret, Foolishness to the Greeks, and The Gospel in a Pluralist Society, Newbigin fleshed out what mission to Western society could look like. 10 It included a public
apologetic against the autonomy of human reason that was overtly indebted to Alasdair MacIntyre and Michael Polanyi but that incorporated the approach of Abraham Kuyper and Herman
Bavinck as well. It also emphasized equipping believers to integrate their faith and work, changing society as they moved out into their vocations in the world, as well as emphasizing the
importance of the Christian church as a "hermeneutic of the gospel." Newbigin believed that the love, justice, and peace that ought to characterize the Christian counterculture were primary
ways of bearing witness to God in a pluralistic society. With these last two emphases - the renewal of society and the church as a "contrast" community-Newbigin combines several of the
cultural approaches we looked at earlier.

> **INGREDIENTS FOR A MISSIONARY ENCOUNTER**  
> Newbigin gives his short list of ingredients for a "missionary encounter with Western culture" that includes the following elements:11
> 1. a new apologetic (that takes on the so-called neutrality of secular reason)
> 2. the teaching of the kingdom of God (that God wants not only to save souls but heal the whole creation)
> 3. earning the right to be heard through willingness to serve others sacrificially
> 4. equipping the laity to bring the implications of their faith into their public calling and so transform culture
> 5. a countercultural church community
> 6. a unified church that shows the world an overcoming of denominational divisions
> 7. a global church in which the older Western churches listen to the non-Western churches
> 8. courage
>
> Compare this list with David Bosch's short list from Believing in the Future summarized in this section.

Most important, Newbigin proposed something of a middle way (though he never used that term) with the missio Dei. In his critical review of Konrad Raiser's book defending the
approach of the World Council of Churches, he wrote the following:  
> Raiser, of course, is absolutely right to protest against an ecclesiocentric concept of mission, as though the church were the author and the goal of mission. But this whole vision is too much
shaped by the ideology of the 1960s with its faith in the secular, and in human power to solve problems. The thesis is heavily marked by a model... that interprets all situations in terms of
the oppressor and the oppressed and that tends to interpret the struggles of the oppressed as the instrument of redemption. This model owed not a little to Marxist thought, and the collapse
of Marxism as a world power has created a new situation with which the WCC has to come to terms.12
> 
> Newbigin rejected the direct identification of God's redemption with any movement that improves socioeconomic well-being. He rightly said that the idea of defining mission as "what
God is doing out in history" too closely draws its origins from the Marxist ideas of class struggle as the meaning of history. But then Newbigin sought to strike a note of balance:
> 
> The (literally) crucial matter is the centrality of Jesus and his atoning work on the cross, that work by which he has won lordship over the church and the world...
>
> It is one of the most pressing tasks for the immediate future to rediscover a doctrine of redemption that sees the cross not as the banner of the oppressed against the oppressor but as
the action of God that brings both judgment and redemption for all who will accept it, yet does not subvert the proper struggle for the measure of justice that is possible in a world of sinful
human beings. 13

Here Newbigin takes the struggle for justice in the world out from the center of the meaning of redemption. Redemption is first of all the action of God in Christ, and this action calls for
a decision. It must be accepted, not rejected. 14 And yet there is still a place for us to struggle for the "measure of justice" in this world.

In his book Transforming Mission, David Bosch further develops Newbigin's idea of the missio Dei. In Bosch's examination of Luke's theology of mission, he sees a charge to proclaim
Christ and the call for conversion, as well as to show God's concern for justice for the poor. In his Believing in the Future, Bosch goes further in spelling out a vision for mission in a post-
Christian West. He restates the core idea of the missio Dei — that God's mission is to restore creation, and the church is called to participate in this mission. Bosch says that mission is not
just "recruitment to our brand of religion; it is alerting people to the universal reign of God."15 Then he suggests how this may be done. First, he says, we must avoid two opposing errors: (1)
trying to re-create a Christian society (the mistake of medieval Christendom) and (2) withdrawal from society into the "spiritual realm" (the mistake of modernity). 16 Second, we must learn
how to publicly and prophetically challenge the idol of autonomous reason and its results.17 Third, we must take pains to make our churches into contrast societies, countercultures that
show society what human life looks like free from the idols of race, wealth, sex, power, and individual autonomy.18 So we contextualize our message in ways that avoid syncretism on the one
extreme and irrelevance on the other; we better equip the laity for their public callings; and we cultivate vital, life-shaping worship as the dynamic heart of mission. These steps show the
world a countercultural model of society and shape people so that the gospel influences how they live in the world. 19 Finally, we must model to the world as much unity between churches as
is practically possible.

An insight animating all of this work is the idea of the cultural captivity of the church in the West. Bosch, like Newbigin, is especially critical of Enlightenment rationalism and its various
effects in Western culture - materialism, consumerism, individualism, and the breakdown of community. He maintains that the church is too deeply shaped by the spirit of the age, in both
its conservative and liberal forms. In its liberal form, it has bought uncritically into a secular account of things, de-supernaturalizing the gospel so that the Spirit's work is seen mainly in
secular movements of liberation, thus turning the liberal mainline churches into little more than social service centers where the language of secular rights activists reigns. In its conservative
form, it has bought uncritically into the idea of religion as the fulfillment of individual consumer needs, thus turning the conservative church into something like felt-need shopping centers
where the language of modern therapy and marketing reigns. People see Christ as a way to self-fulfillment and prosperity, not as a model for radical service to others. Both wings of the
Christian church are, then, captive to the reigning idols of Western culture. 20 They are failing to challenge these idols in their preaching and practice.

Because of the influential writings of Newbigin and Bosch, a new, more fully realized understanding of the missio Dei was developing by the mid-1990s. It sought to avoid the
secularization of mission found in the liberal churches. The overarching narrative was still that God is in mission to renew the whole creation, but the new view stressed the public
proclamation of Christ as Lord and Hope of the world and therefore the necessity of both conversion and the growth of the church. This new, rehabilitated view of the missio Dei began to
capture the attention of many Christians outside of the liberal mainline who were struggling with the question of how to relate to an increasingly post-Christian culture.

## THE MISSIONAL CHURCH MOVEMENT TODAY
When Missional Church (edited by Darrell Guder) first appeared in 1998, it built on this new understanding of missio Dei that had been previously developed by Lesslie Newbigin and David Bosch. The book laid out the same dilemma: the culture was no longer Christianized and now the church was "on the mission field to the modern world," yet the church was captive to the
culture of modernity and thus had no real alternative to offer. The church must therefore reform itself and discover new ways to engage culture. But how was this to be done? Again, the
answers sounded many of the same themes as Newbigin and Bosch: the church as a contrast community, contextualization of the message, concern not only for church growth but also for
justice. The book's theological commitments were firmly based on the concept of the mission as participation in the purpose of the triune God to redeem creation.22

> **WHY DID WE LOSE CHRISTENDOM?**
> What caused Christianity to lose so much influence in the West, especially after World War II? Lesslie Newbigin understands historical patterns as being caused by ideas and
intellectual trends working their way out through a society's institutions. He blames the outworking of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment — promoting the sufficiency
of individual human reason with no need for faith in God-for a great deal of the shift.
>
> Ross Douthat's book Bad Religion provides a somewhat different and illuminating account of the loss of Christendom in the United States after World War II. He attributes the
change to five major social catalysts:21
> 1. political polarization between left and right, which took many churches captive (mainline Protestants toward the left, evangelicals toward the right) and
weakened credibility
> 2. the sexual revolution and the birth control pill that fueled it
> 3. the dawn of globalization and the impression that Christianity was imperialistically Western
> 4. the enormous growth in the kind of material prosperity that always works against faith
> 5. the loss of the elites and the academic cultural institutions they control (see ch. 2, "The Locust Years")
>
> I see no reason why Newbigin's history-of-thought approach and Douthat's sociology-of-knowledge approach cannot both be right. A third strain of analysis could easily find
the faults within the church itself. As H. Richard Niebuhr points out in his essay "Toward the Independence of the Church," the church becomes weak and even corrupt when
it becomes successful in a culture.25
>
> For example, why did the mainline and the evangelical church get co-opted by American political parties and lose credibility? Was it not due to a lack of robust, vital
orthodoxy within these bodies? For more, see the discussion of Niebuhr's essay and this dynamic in part 5 of this book (pp. 237 - 38). If all these approaches are indeed
complementary and their conclusions are on point, Christianity in the West has been the victim of "a perfect storm" of trends, factors, and forces.

The time for these ideas was ripe, and the term "missional church" became popular in evangelical circles. The evangelical church as a whole was becoming aware of the cultural shift
happening around them and the growing ineffectiveness of much of the traditional ministry approach. Some in the mainline church were becoming disenchanted with the emptiness of
ecumenical theology, but they were either unable or not interested to join the evangelical movement. Many of these church leaders picked up the basic vision for the missional church in
Western culture found in Guder's book.

But many people picked up the ideas of the missio Dei and the missional church and supplemented them with other theological and cultural content, which has led to a dizzying variety
of different and sometimes contradictory definitions of the term missional. Craig Van Gelder has written an entire volume just trying to categorize the different approaches and definitions
around the idea. He and his colleague Dwight Zscheile have discerned four broad, overlapping "streams" of the missional conversation:  
**1. Being missional is being evangelistic**. Some churches (and authors) have simply adopted missional as a synonym for being highly committed to evangelism and foreign missions. Like
all expressions of being missional, the starting point is how our culture has changed, how outreach requires more ingenuity and diligence than ever, and the assertion that every Christian is a
missionary. Those in this category also usually embrace a somewhat more holistic approach to outreach, encouraging various forms of community service. However, the underlying theology
is quite traditional. Mission is largely conceived as bringing people into individual salvation through the church. The distinctive ideas of the missio Dei — the work of God's Spirit in the world
to restore all creation and the cultural captivity of the Western church — are missing.23  
**2. Being missional is being incarnational**. Another set of voices criticizes the Christendom model of church as "attractional." The attractional model is based on non-Christians coming
or being invited into the programs and ministries of the church. They come in to hear the preaching, to participate in programs that minister to their felt needs, or to attend for baptisms,
weddings, and funerals. This, it is said, is now an obsolete model (though it still works in more traditional parts of the West and with the shrinking body of "Christianized" non-Christians).
In place of the attractional model, they recommend an incarnational model, where Christians live geographically close to each other, create a thick and rich community among
themselves, and then become deeply involved in the civic and corporate life of their neighborhood or city. Church planting in this paradigm does not need to begin with a full-time minister,
a core group, and a worship service. Instead, a few Christian families move into a neighborhood and fully participate in its life, discover the needs of the citizens, and begin to meet them in
Christ's name. Christian community grows organically, gradually coming to include many of the nonbelievers who labor for peace and justice in the neighborhood. In general, the adoption of
this view leads to the proliferation of informal house churches.24  
**3. Being missional is being contextual**. Some thinkers put more emphasis on the shifts in late modern and postmodern culture, the cultural captivity of the church, and therefore
the need to contextualize every part of the church's ministry so it engages this post-Christendom reality. This approach includes aspects of the first two views, as thinkers in this category
emphasize being ingeniously evangelistic and incarnational in the community — but they go further. In this view it is possible to deepen Christian community and be involved in community
service and yet still be a subculture that does not really engage post-Christian Western society. To be a truly missional church involves deep reflection on culture and discovering creative ways
of communication and church practice that both adapt to culture and challenge it. Those who fall into this category appreciate the incarnational house church model but see it as one good
and possible ministry form among many others.
Van Gelder and Zscheile list authors who advance this view, and many of them seem to assume a more traditional evangelical theology than those in the final category.26 Still, they all
accept that the basic measures proposed by Newbigin for a "missionary encounter with Western culture" - a new apologetic, the church as contrast community, holistic outreach, engaging
culture through vocations are correct. In their own works, they seek to flesh out what Newbigin's measures might look like.  
**4. Being missional is being reciprocal and communal**. This group of thinkers applauds the emphases of the other three. They are glad to affirm that every Christian is in mission. They
support the idea of the church as far more incarnationally involved in the life of its community, and they believe firmly in the importance of contextualization and cultural engagement. They
do not, however, believe the others have taken the implications of the missio Dei far enough. They believe missio Dei calls us to a careful reworking of both our theology and practice.

> **SELF AND THE FULFILLMENT OF ITS NEEDS**
> Alan Roxburgh and Scott Boren have more to say about the impact of individualism:
>
> _When we attend to the way people talk about the gospel, it does not take long to discover just how much the focus lies on meeting personal needs. During testimony
sessions about mission trips, people explain how it changed them or how it gave them an experience they will never forget. In modernity the purpose of life is to
fulfill one's personal destiny, goals, or needs ... For moderns, it's almost impossible to read the biblical narrative without assimilating it to the modern categories of
the self and the fulfillment of its needs._
>
> In Scripture, mission calls a people into a radically different vision on a journey bigger and other than ourselves. Scripture calls us into the memory of an amazing
story... not for ourselves but for the sake of the world. The strangeness of this story is its illogical and irrepressible meaning: find life by losing it; only by leaving the
places of security are the purposes of God discovered. The God revealed in Scripture gives himself away for the sake of the world.27

Those who adopt this approach have arrived at two conclusions. First, if God already has a mission, then a church should not do mission by designing methods to draw people into their
services. It must be responsive to what God is already doing in the world. Alan Roxburgh, one of the original essayists in Missional Church, writes that the one question missional churches ask
over and over is this: "What is God up to in this neighborhood?” The missional church listens to people in the community and “becomes open to being surprised by God's purposes."28 Rather
than simply announcing to the world what it needs to know, the church listens and learns what God is doing and then gets involved.

Second, in order to overcome the Enlightenment's individualism, the church must redefine sin, mission, and salvation in corporate and communal terms. Rather than speaking of
sin primarily as an offense against a holy God, sin is seen, in horizontal terms, as the violation of God's shalom in the world through selfishness, violence, injustice, and pride.29 Rather
than speaking of the cross as primarily the place where Jesus satisfied the wrath of God on our sin, Jesus' death is seen as the occasion when the powers of this world fell on Jesus and
were defeated.30 Mission, then, is ultimately not about getting individuals right with God but about incorporating them into a new community that partners with God in redeeming social
structures and healing the world.31

## WHAT DO THESE APPROACHES HAVE IN COMMON?
Many conservative evangelicals reject the term missional because of its association with emerging church thinkers such as Brian McLaren, because of its connection to the ecumenical
movement and the theology of Karl Barth, or simply because it is such a hard word to define.32

I sympathize. But the fact remains that a large number of Christian believers today are on an earnest search for the missional church, regardless of whether or not they use the term.
Those who hold to conservative doctrines often inhabit the first category - "missional as evangelistic" — and are now beginning to populate the second and third categories - "missional
as incarnational" and "missional as contextual." Those with liberal and mainline church beliefs are also found in the second and third categories but are especially attracted to the fourth
category ("missional as reciprocal and communal").33

Despite very real and important differences among these four missional streams, I believe they have important things in common. In the remainder of the chapter, I'll summarize the
primary areas of consensus and strength in the missional conversation.

### THE POST-CHRISTENDOM AGE
First, we have entered a post-Christian or post-Christendom age. For centuries in the Western world, the Christian church had a privileged place, but this is no longer true. Rather than being a
force at the center of culture, Christianity has moved to the margins. There is broad recognition that the church had allowed cultural institutions to do a lot of its heavy lifting, infusing people
with a broadly Christian way of thinking about things - respect for the Bible, allegiance to the Ten Commandments, commitment to the ethical teachings of the Gospels; belief in a personal
God, an afterlife, a judgment day, and moral absolutes. But no longer can we expect people who already have these basic beliefs to simply come to church through social pressure and out of
custom. The times have changed.

### CULTURAL CAPTIVITY OF THE CHURCH
Second, those in the incarnational, contextual, and communal/reciprocal streams further recognize the cultural captivity of the church and the need to contextualize the gospel message so it
is both comprehensible and challenging for those in a pluralistic, late-modern society. Many call for a gospel that escapes cultural captivity by challenging the Enlightenment individualism of both secular people and certain members of evangelical churches. Alan Roxburgh and Scott Boren write, “Modernity replaces mission with self-actualization of the expressive, autonomous
individual,”34 and it is this individualism that must be challenged and confronted. Newbigin argues that the church must also unmask the autonomy of human reason. Remember that
contextualization means showing how only in Christ can the baseline narratives of a culture be resolved. To the self-absorbed culture we say, "You must lose yourself — in service to Christ
and others — to truly find yourself." To the rationalistic culture we say, "You cannot have the things you want — meaning, dignity, hope, character, shared values, and community — without
faith."

### SENT OUT TO BE A BLESSING
Third, all those pursuing the missional church also believe that Christian mission is more than just a department of the church, more than just the work of trained professionals. The biblical
God is by nature a sending God, a missionary God.35 The Father sends the Son; the Son sends the Spirit and his disciples into the world. Therefore the whole church is in mission; every
Christian is in mission. God never calls you in to bless you without also sending you out to be a blessing (Gen 12:1-3; cf. 1 Pet 2:9). So a Christian is not a spiritual consumer, coming in to get
his or her emotional needs met and then going home. A missional church, then, is one that trains and encourages its people to be in mission as individuals and as a body. All of the voices in
the missional conversation agree that the church must not be only attractional; it also must equip and send the laity into the world to minister.

One implication of this view is that missional churches must equip laypeople both for evangelistic witness and for public life and vocation. In Christendom, you could afford to train
people solely in prayer, Bible study, and evangelism — skills for their private lives - because they were not facing radically non-Christian values in their public lives. In a missional church,
all people need theological education to "think Christianly" about everything and to act with Christian distinctiveness. They need to know which cultural practices reflect common grace and
should be embraced, which are antithetical to the gospel and must be rejected, and which practices can be adapted or revised.36

### A CONTRAST COMMUNITY
Finally, most missional thinkers agree that in our Western culture, we must be a contrast community, a counterculture. The quality, distinctiveness, and beauty of our communal life must be a
major part of our witness and mission to the world. Jesus stated that the quality and visibility of Christians' love for each other will show the world that the Father sent him (John 17:20-21).
In other words, our mission cannot go forward without Christians being involved not only in calling people to conversion but also in service to the community and in doing justice.37 This is
part of the balance Newbigin struck. While many in the liberal church redefine evangelism as seeking a more just society and many conservative churches see Christians' work in the world as
strictly proclamation and conversion, most missional thinkers agree that the witness of Christians must be in both word and deed.

> **WHAT IS A "MISSIONAL" SMALL GROUP?**
> A missional mind-set can and should pervade every area of the church. For example, let's consider what a missional small group could look like. It is more than just a group of
people involved in a specific evangelism program (although that is a good thing). Rather, its members love the city and talk positively about it; they speak in language that is
not filled with pious tribal or technical terms and phrases, nor do they use disdainful or combative language. In their Bible study, they apply the gospel to the core concerns
and stories of the people in their culture. This is a group obviously interested in and engaged with the literature, art, and thought of the surrounding culture, and they can
discuss it appreciatively and yet critically. They exhibit deep concern for the poor, are generous with their money, model purity and respect toward the opposite sex, and show
humility toward people of other races and cultures, as well as toward other Christians and churches.

Part of being this kind of counterculture involves loving the city — its culture and people. Often, churches gather around them people who do not like the city or who do not expect to
stay there. This inclination can occur among conservative churches that despise the secular, immoral society around them or with churches comprised largely of expatriates or immigrants from other countries. Such churches are often indifferent or hostile to their own locale, and as a result, most of the long-term residents of the community will feel unwelcome in these
churches. A missional church enjoys, cares for, and prays for its city.

Another aspect of this contrast community is unity across church communities and denominations. In Christendom, when "everyone was a Christian," it was perhaps useful for a
church to define itself primarily in contrast with other churches. Today, however, it is much more illuminating and helpful for a church to define itself in relationship to the values of the
secular culture. If we spend our time bashing and criticizing other kinds of churches, we simply play into the common defeater that all Christians are intolerant. While it is right to align
ourselves with denominations that share many of our distinctives, at the local level we should cooperate with, reach out to, and support the other congregations and ministries in our local
area. To do so will raise many thorny issues, of course, but our bent should be in the direction of cooperation.

I believe these points of common ground in the missional conversation are sound and generally consistent with a Center Church theological vision. I would use the phrase "missional
church" less cautiously and more expansively if these were indeed understood to be the key aspects of the definition.

Still, as fruitful as the search for the missional church has been, it has not always taken the church into friendly or helpful territory. Significant and important differences exist among
various groupings in the missional conversation. In the next chapter, I'll look at key dangers and imbalances induced by some of the thinkers and practitioners in the missional conversation
and suggest some course corrections.

> **QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION AND REFLECTION**
> 1. Keller writes, "The word [missional] has significantly different meanings and is used in different ways by different authors, organizations, and churches - -leading to
much confusion about what, exactly, the term missional means." How have you used or defined missional? How has this chapter changed or contributed to your
understanding of this term?  
> 2. The concept of missio dei suggests that "God does not merely send the church in mission. God already is in mission, and the church must join him." What do you believe is
the mission of God and what role does the church have in that mission? How would you distinguish between the mission of God and the mission of the church?  
> 3. Of the four understandings of "missional" presented in this chapter, which most closely aligns with your own? What is it about the other understandings that you find
objectionable?  
> 4. Four common emphases characterize those who embrace the idea of being missional:
>    - acknowledging that we have entered a post-Christian age in the West
>    - recognizing the cultural captivity of the church and the need to contextualize the gospel for a pluralistic society
>    - affirming that mission is the job of every Christian
>    - calling the church to be a contrast community  
>
> What are some of the unique elements of each emphasis that are discussed in this chapter? Which of these resonated most with you as you read about them? Which is the
most difficult to persuade others of within your community?
