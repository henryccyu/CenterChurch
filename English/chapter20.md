# chapter 20 CENTERING THE MISSIONAL CHURCH
Though a clear and valuable benefit exists in identifying the common ground of the missional church, the range of differences among various definitions and viewpoints is great, and many
aspects of the visions for "missional living” contradict each other. Everyone involved in the missional conversation concludes that others are making significant errors, and I am no different
in this regard. As I have observed the ongoing conversation about the missional church and tested many of these ideas as a practitioner, I have three primary concerns with the way some
segments of the missional conversation are appropriating the core insights outlined at the end of the previous chapter. We need to learn how to discern and avoid each of these problems if we
are to be effective in developing a ministry with a Center Church orientation.

## PROBLEM #1: NOT COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH
First, we examine the branch of the conversation that sees the missional church as simply being evangelistic. I agree that any missional church must be pervasively, intensely evangelistic in
the common use of the word - we must call people to personal conversion. However, the typical evangelical gospel presentation is too shallow. It speaks cursorily about a God whom we have
sinned against, a Savior who died for our sins, and a call to believe in this Savior. The simplicity of this communication presumes that those listening share the same essential understanding
of the words God and sin as the speaker.

But what if a growing majority of people outside the church live by such a radically different view of life that much of what is now said and done by the Christian community is
inexplicable or even deeply offensive to them? What if many listeners hold a profoundly different understanding of the concepts of God, truth, right and wrong, freedom, virtue, and sin?
What if their approaches to reality, human nature and destiny, and human community are wholly different from our own?

For decades, this has been the situation facing Christian churches in many areas around the world — places such as India, Iran, and Japan. Evangelism in these environments involves
a lengthy process in which nonbelievers have to be invited into a Christian community that bridges the gap between Christian truth and the culture around it. Every part of a church's life —
its worship, community, public discourse, preaching, and education — has to assume the presence of nonbelievers from the surrounding culture. The aesthetics of its worship have to reflect
the sensibilities of the culture and yet show how Christian belief shapes and is expressed through them. Its preaching and teaching have to show how the hopes of this culture's people can
find fulfillment only in Christ. Most of all, such a congregation's believers have to reflect the demographic makeup of the surrounding community, thereby giving non-Christian neighbors
attractive and challenging glimpses of what they would look like as Christians.

One reason much of the evangelical church in the United States has not yet experienced the same precipitous decline as the Protestant churches of Europe and Canada is that,
unlike these places, the U.S. still includes sizable remnants of Christendom. We have places where the informal public culture (though not the formal public institutions) still stigmatizes
non-Christian beliefs and behavior. There is, according to journalist Michael Wolff, a “fundamental schism in American cultural, political, and economic life. There's the quicker-growing,
economically vibrant ... morally relativist, urban-oriented, culturally adventuresome, sexually polymorphous, and ethnically diverse nation ... And there's the small-town, nuclear-family,
religiously oriented, white-centric other America, [with] ... its diminishing cultural and economic force... two countries."1

To reach this growing post-Christendom society in the West will obviously take more than what we ordinarily call an evangelistic church; it will take a missional church. This church's
worship is missional in that it makes sense to nonbelievers in that culture, even while it challenges and shapes Christians with the gospel.2 Its people are missional in that they are so
outwardly focused, so involved in addressing the needs of the local community, that the church is well-known for its compassion. The members of a missional church also know how to
contextualize the gospel, carefully challenging yet also appealing to the baseline cultural narratives of the society around them.3 Finally, because of the attractiveness of its people's character
and lives, a missional church will always have some outsiders who are drawn into its community to incubate and explore the Christian faith in its midst.

So the idea that "to be missional is to be evangelistic" is too narrow. A missional church is not less than an evangelistic church, but it is much more.

## PROBLEM #2: TOO TIED TO A PARTICULAR FORM
A second major problem is the tendency to put too much emphasis on a particular church form. Many who participate in missional church discussions insist that the church should be
incarnational rather than attractional.4 If taken as a broad principle, this is a correct statement. That is, if an attractional church is understood as tribal, as showing little concern for the
broader community, drawing people in from the world and absorbing them into internal church programs that only meet their felt needs rather than equipping them to serve — then a
missional church should not be attractional. 5 And if incarnational can be defined as a church that listens to its community to learn what its needs are, speaks and interacts with its community
with respect, equips and sends its people out to love and serve - then all missional churches should be incarnational.

However, many argue that any church that bases its ministry on bringing people in to a large weekly meeting cannot be missional. David Fitch, a pastor in the missional community Life
on the Vine, writes the following about megachurches:
> _Mega-church... packages a service to speak a message that they assume can make sense to anonymous guests. Missional assumes the opposite — that people have no language or history by
which to understand the words "Jesus is Lord." Therefore we must incarnate/embody the gospel for it to make sense. A packaged entertaining speaker/program every Sunday simply cannot
do the job of communicating the gospel in post-Christendom._

Fitch asserts that non-Christians in a post-Christian society will be so completely unable to understand the gospel that any mere verbal presentation of it will not be compelling or
understood. In addition, he argues that any church that focuses on a large weekly gathering will by necessity require too much time and money for the church to be missional. For Fitch, to be
missional is "to spend most of one's time and ministry outside the four walls of a church building, inhabiting a neighborhood learning who they are, what they do, and where the spiritual/
holistic needs are. Its rhythm contradicts the rhythm of an attractional church."7

Many believe, along with Fitch, that a missional church cannot take the form of a large church or even of a small traditional church that is centered on a weekly worship and preaching
service. Those who hold this view organize either as small house churches (ten to fifty people) with bivocational pastors and leaders or as a network of midsize house churches that gather for
larger "attractional" meetings occasionally.

> **MISSIONAL COMMUNITIES**
> A practical resource for creating a missional church is Mike Breen's Launching Missional Communities: A Field Guide.& Key attributes of a missional community include:  
> - Size. A missional community is larger than six to twelve persons, the size of a typical small cell group. Small groups tend to be inwardly focused; also, most small
groups do not endure for a long time. Instead, missional communities of twenty to fifty persons are more like the size of an extended family. Groupings of this
size are said to be "large enough to dare; small enough to care."
> - Focus. These communities meet regularly for fellowship and mutual edification and also to take responsibility to serve and reach a particular neighborhood
or group of people. Examples mentioned in Launching Missional Communities include serving a Slovakian gypsy population, Somalian refugees, university
students, a wealthy neighborhood, a poor neighborhood, young parents, Iranians (including Muslims), and parents of teenagers.
> - Center of gravity. "The center of gravity" in this church form is the midsize missional community, not the large, weekly worship gathering. Small groups are
optional, and large worship gatherings are often episodic or nonexistent. Breen suggests that missional communities meet with others for preaching and
celebration in a Sunday large worship gathering "no less than once a month and no more than three times a month."
>
>   Michael Frost and Alan Hirsch address this model:  
>   Most of the emerging churches we have been able to uncover are quite intentional about developing smaller communities ... It is also much closer to New Testament ecclesiology and
missions practice. The household church unit was the primary unit of missional community in the New Testament. Today whether they meet in homes like the contemporary house church
movement or not is irrelevant. What is important is that they tend to be smaller, more diverse, less organized, life-oriented, missional, relational, faith communities, not requiring their
own specialized churchy buildings.2

I believe this view presents too rigid an understanding of the missional church. I pastored a small church in a small, working-class town for nearly ten years. My church naturally had
the kind of characteristics that house churches are seeking to create through intentional planning. Missional communities seek to re-create the oikos - the large, extended family of children,
grandchildren, relatives, business associates, and neighbors that constituted most churches in the New Testament — and insist that ministry should be informal, relational, and organic.10

However, the midsized groups that are gathered into missional communities are not truly oikoi. They are usually not related to each other by a variety of blood ties, do not work in
the same shops and plants, have not gone to the same schools, and have not belonged to the same clubs and civic organizations — which is how people in a small town know one another.
The Christians in my church did not have to find ways to know their geographic neighbors; they were already deeply enmeshed with them. All the believers lived within a few miles of one
another and rarely moved out of the area. We ate together, spent lots of time in each other's homes, and were deeply involved in each other's lives apart from Sunday services. And because of
these durable and multivalent relationships, a great deal of outreach, pastoral care, fellowship, and community service did indeed happen organically through relationships. In short, small
churches in small towns have, in general, the kind of relationships with each other and the surrounding community that missional communities seek to forge.

For more than twenty years, I've led a very large church in Manhattan in which we have significant mobility and turnover and in which people learn, do ministry, and are cared for
mainly through large-scale programs. My conclusion? Both churches had seasons of evangelistic fruitfulness. In many cases, the traditional gathered church does tend to draw people "inside
the walls" instead of sending and supporting Christians out to minister in their networks of relationships. However, in my own experience, my large urban congregation-particularly in its
first decade - was, by and large, far more effective than the small church I served in reaching unchurched and non-Christian people. In the final analysis, I don't believe any single form of
church (small or large, cell group based or midsize community based) is intrinsically better at growing spiritual fruit, reaching nonbelievers, caring for people, and producing Christ-shaped
lives. I say "in the final analysis" because each approach to church—the small, organic, simple incarnational church, and the large, organizational, complex attractional church has vastly
different strengths and weaknesses, limitations and capabilities.

Alan Roxburgh, in his role as a consultant, finds that one of the first questions people ask him is this: "Can you show me a missional church model?"11 They want a specific way of doing
church, with a concrete pattern they can emulate. He rejects the very question, and so should we. Look again at the outline of the features of an effective missional church (pp. 256-58). Those
features can be present or absent within any church model and size. Nearly any type of church may embrace or resist these features, though in different ways. All kinds are thriving; and all
kinds are failing.

So the idea that "the missional church is the smaller house church" is shortsighted.

## PROBLEM #3: LOSS OF A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE GOSPEL
My third and greatest concern is that, while all missional church books use the term gospel constantly, it is obvious they do not mean the same thing by the term. This is a very serious problem.
It is especially true of those who see being missional primarily in communal/reciprocal terms (though it occurs in the other categories as well).

The final result of God's redeeming work in Christ will be a completely renewed cosmos-a new heaven and a new earth. Therefore we can say that God is out not only to pardon and save
our souls but also to heal all the ways sin has ruined the creation. However, some stress this aspect of God's saving program to the virtual exclusion of any attention to individual conversion.
The reason is, as we have seen, that many redefine sin and salvation in completely corporate or horizontal terms. In their view, sin is mainly the selfishness, pride, greed, and violence that
destroy community and God's creation. Accordingly, Christ's redemption is primarily the defeat of the forces of evil in the world that cause the harm, and the Spirit's application of this
redemption is by means of tearing down barriers and moving toward a human society of sharing, egalitarianism, and mutuality. Finally, becoming a Christian is not about being reconciled to
God through repentance and faith but about joining the new community that is at work to bring about a world of peace and justice. The classic doctrines regarding sin — as an offense against
