# Chapter 19 THE SEARCH FOR THE MISSIONAL CHURCH

The word missional first became popular after the 1998 publication of the book titled Missional Church and in the years since it has been adopted and used widely.¹ Many are asking, “How
can we really be missional?" An entire generation of younger evangelical leaders has grown up searching for the true missional church as if for the Holy Grail. Seemingly a dozen books come
out each year with the word missional in their title, but a survey of these books reveals that the word has significantly different meanings and is used in different ways by different authors,
organizations, and churches-leading to much confusion about what, exactly, the term missional means.

Before the term missional exploded throughout the Christian world, it was primarily used in mainline Protestant and ecumenical circles in a manner closely associated with the Latin
phrase missio Dei. The phrase was originally coined to convey the teaching of Karl Barth about the action of God in the world. According to Lesslie Newbigin, the term missio Dei became
prominent after the 1952 world mission conference in Willingen, Germany. It was a way of referring to the idea that God is active in the world, working to redeem the entire creation, and that
the church's task is to participate in this mission.2

In his influential 1991 book Transforming Mission, David Bosch explained that the term missio Dei was firmly grounded in Trinitarian theology. Bosch noted that in the past, mission was
largely viewed as a category of soteriology (as a way to save souls) or as a category of ecclesiology (as a way to expand the church). In contrast, the concept of missio Dei implied that mission
should be "understood as being derived from the very nature of God ... put in the context of the doctrine of the Trinity, not of ecclesiology or soteriology."3 The Trinity is, by nature, "sending."
The Father sends the Son into the world to save it, and the Father and the Son send the Spirit into the world. And now, said Bosch, the Spirit is sending the church. In short, God does not merely
send the church in mission. God already is in mission, and the church must join him. This also means, then, that the church does not simply have a missions department; it should wholly
exist to be a mission.

At first glance, this seemed to be a strong and sound theology of mission. As time went on, however, it meant the church actually came to be seen as less relevant. Lesslie Newbigin wrote
these words in the late 1970s:

> If God is indeed the true missionary, it was said, our business is to not promote the mission of the church, but to get out into the world, find out "what God is doing in the world," and join
forces with him. And "what God is doing" was generally thought to be in the secular rather than in the religious sectors of human life. The effect, of course, was to look for what seemed to
be the rising powers and to identify Christians' missionary responsibility with support for a range of political and cultural developments.4

Harvey Cox of Harvard Divinity School wrote, "What God is doing in the world is politics... Theology today must [therefore] be that reflection-in-action by which the church finds out
what this politician-God is up to and moves in to work along with him."5 In many mainline and ecumenical circles, mission came to mean working with secular human rights movements
or rising left-wing political organizations. The results, Newbigin wrote, were "sometimes bizarre indeed. Even Chairman Mao's 'little red book' became almost a new Bible."6 Newbigin, who
was one of the key people involved in the forming of the World Council of Churches, became increasingly concerned that the concept of the missio Dei left little need for the church. The
church could not meet human needs as well as social service agencies could, nor could it change society as well as political parties and organizations could. So in this view, the church became
inconsequential.

> **NEWBIGIN AND THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES**
> Though many evangelicals have appropriated his ideas, Lesslie Newbigin himself never claimed to be an evangelical. He openly repudiated the evangelical doctrine of
Scripture and held to the Barthian idea that God's sovereign election of people was not to salvation but only to service. Newbigin, at a number of places in his writing, seems
to veer close to universalism.
>
> Nevertheless, as time went on, he became more and more critical of the liberal theology of the WCC. Originally, the WCC was committed to a "Christo-centric universalism";
that is, the denominations of the WCC put all other doctrinal differences aside except their common commitment to Christ in order to make the unity of the church
prominently visible as part of its mission to the world. After the appointment in 1992 of Konrad Raiser as general secretary of the WCC, the organization moved to a new
position in which the only necessary basis for solidarity in mission was commitment to the transformation of society for justice and peace. Raiser defended his approach in
Ecumenism in Transition: A Paradigm Shift for the Ecumenical Movement? Raiser's approach essentially left Christ out of the Trinity. He argued that the Father's will was for
justice, peace, and the restoration of creation, and he sent his Spirit out into the world to accomplish this in all sorts of ways, many or most of them having nothing to do with
Christianity or the church.
>
> This was the very thing Newbigin had criticized in The Open Secret. Newbigin wrote a scathing review of Raiser's book in which he argued that Christ and his atoning death
are central to Christian mission, and that, though "I do not want to endorse all that is done by the churches and movements that bear the name 'evangelical'... it is a very
important fact that these bodies are the ones that are growing and showing increasing breadth of vision in their approach to the whole range of contemporary human
problems, while the bodies that hold the doctrinal position represented in this book are largely in decline."8

In The Open Secret, Newbigin criticized what he called the "secularization" of mission. He argued that conversions, the growth of the church, and the quality of Christian community
were all critical and central to mission. Newbigin looked with favor on the theories of missiologist Donald McGavran, who taught that the purpose of mission was "church growth" in quality
and quantity. Nevertheless, Newbigin retained the term missio Dei and its original theological concept of a missionary God. He insisted that the church needed to grow through evangelism
yet be involved in service and in the struggle for justice in the world as well. Newbigin sought to uphold the basic idea of the missio Dei, but he tried to save it from the excesses and distortions
of the ecumenical movement.

## THE NEWBIGIN-BOSCH RESCUE
Lesslie Newbigin had been a British missionary in India for several decades. When he returned to England in the mid-1970s, he saw the massive decline of the church and Christian influence
that had occurred in his absence. At the time he left England, Western society's main cultural institutions still Christianized people, and the churches were easily gathering those who came
to their doors through social expectation and custom. Churches in the West had always supported "missions" in overseas non-Christian cultures (such as India). There on the "mission field,"
churches functioned in a different way than they did in Europe and North America. Churches in India did not merely support missions or even do missions - they were missional in every
aspect. They could not simply process Christianized people as churches did in the West. Rather, every aspect of their church life-worship, preaching, community life, and discipleship - had
to be a form of mission.

For example, on the mission field, visitors to a worship service could not be expected to have any familiarity with Christianity. Therefore the worship and preaching had to address them
in ways both comprehensible and challenging. On the mission field, believers lived in a society with radically different values from those they were taught in church. This made "life in the
world" very complicated for Christians. Discipleship and training had to equip believers to answer many hostile questions from their neighbors. It also had to spell out Christian personal and
corporate behavior patterns that distinguished them and showed society what the kingdom of God was all about. In other words, away from the West, churches did not simply have a missions
department; Christians were "in mission" in every aspect of their public and private lives.

When he returned to England, Newbigin discovered that the ground had shifted. The cultural institutions of society were now indifferent or overtly hostile to Christian faith, and the
number of people who went to church had plummeted. Western culture was fast becoming a non-Christian society — a “mission field” — but the churches were making little adjustment.
