# Chapter 2 THE GOSPEL IS NOT A SIMPLE THING
The gospel is not everything, yet in the final analysis it cannot be tamed into a single simple formula with a number of points that must be recited to everyone, in every time and place. There is
an irreducible complexity to the gospel. I do not mean that the gospel can't be presented simply and even very briefly. Paul himself does so on numerous occasions (e.g., Rom 10:9). The gospel is
a clear and present word, but it is not a simplistic word.1 Though in the previous chapter I gave an example of a gospel outline that I believe is broadly useful today, I want to resist the impulse,
mainly among conservative evangelicals, toward creating a single, one-size-fits-all gospel presentation that should be used everywhere, that serves as a test of orthodoxy.

### THE BIBLE DOESN'T GIVE ONE STANDARD GOSPEL OUTLINE
In Galatians 1:8, Paul condemns anyone who preaches "a gospel other than the one we preached to you." In 1 Corinthians 15:11, he takes pains to show that the gospel he declares is the same
as that preached by Peter, John, and the others: "Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed." It would be impossible for Paul to condemn a "false
gospel" and affirm the preaching of Peter as "the gospel" without assuming a consensus body of gospel content. And yet it is obvious that the various biblical writers express the gospel in
significantly different ways.

For example, when the Synoptic writers speak about the gospel, they constantly use the concept of "the kingdom," but this phrase is virtually missing in John's gospel, which
emphasizes, rather, receiving "eternal life." On the one hand, we can say that this difference does not at all constitute a contradiction, because when we compare Matthew 25:31-46 and Mark
10:17-31 with John 3:3-6, 17, we see that entering God's kingdom and receiving eternal life are virtually the same thing. Reading Matthew 18:3; Mark 10:15; and John 3:3-6 together reveals
that conversion, the new birth, and receiving the kingdom of God like children are basically the same move.2

Nonetheless, the terms "eternal life" and "the kingdom" are not mere synonyms. The Synoptics use "kingdom" so often because their orientation is more toward the future.3 The terms
convey somewhat different aspects of God's salvation. As many have pointed out, John seems to emphasize the individual and the inward aspects of being in the kingdom of God. He takes
pains to show that the kingdom is not an earthly, sociopolitical order (John 18:36). On the other hand, when the Synoptic writers speak of the kingdom, there is a somewhat more external
and corporate emphasis. They lay out the social and behavioral changes that the gospel brings.4 The kingdom of God does take corporate shape, and it does have major implications for how we
live. It is a new order of things in which money is not made an idol (Mark 10:17-31) and the hungry, naked, and homeless are cared for (Matt 25:31-46). John and the Synoptic writers reveal
complementary aspects of the gospel, stressing both the individual and corporate dimensions of our salvation.

So John and the Synoptic writers present the gospel in somewhat different ways. And when we look at the apostle Paul, we find yet another, different set of emphases. While Paul uses
both "kingdom" and "life," he more centrally focuses on the concept of justification. So is this a different gospel? No. Paul stresses the intercanonical theme of the law court. Jesus takes the
curse of the law, the legal penalty for sin, so we can receive the blessing of Christ's obedience (Gal 3:13–14). Simon Gathercole has shown that there is no real contradiction between the
Synoptic writers, John, and Paul.5 In Jesus, God substitutes himself for us and, on our behalf, pays the debt (Mark 10:45; John 12:20-36; 1 Tim 2:6); defeats the evil powers (Col 2:15; 1 John
3:8); bears the curse and divine wrath (Matt 27:45; Gal 3:13; 1 John 2:2; 4:10), secures for us salvation by grace, not by our works (Eph 2:8-9; 2 Tim 1:9), and even becomes for us an exemplar
(1 Tim 1:16; Heb 12:2; 1 Pet 2:21). At the heart of all of the biblical writers' theology is redemption through substitution.

## THE GOSPEL MUST BE TIED TO THE BIBLE'S STORY LINE AND THEMES
Over the last several decades, as anthropologists and linguists studied “meaning making” through language in a given society, they began to divide their study into two approaches: a
synchronic approach, which is concerned with the whole structure of a language at a given time, and a diachronic approach, which looks at how language and meaning change as a result of
