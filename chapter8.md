# Chapter 8 BALANCED CONTEXTUALIZATION
John Stott's book on preaching, Between Two Worlds, likens Christian communication to building a bridge from the Scriptures to the contemporary world.¹ Some sermons are like
"a bridge to nowhere." They are grounded in solid study of the biblical text but never come down to earth on the other side. That is, they fail to connect the biblical truth to people's
hearts and the issues of their lives. Other sermons are like bridges from nowhere. They reflect on contemporary issues, but the insights they bring to bear on modern problems and
felt needs don't actually arise out of the biblical text. Proper contextualization is the act of bringing sound biblical doctrine all the way over the bridge by reexpressing it in terms
coherent to a particular culture.

How do we do this? Scholars point out that any reader of the Bible who wants to understand it must go back and forth between two different horizons, between the two banks
of the river in Stott's analogy - the biblical text and the reader's cultural context. Scripture has supreme authority, and so it cannot be wrong and does not need to be corrected. But
a Christian communicator's understanding of the Bible may definitely be wrong—indeed, is always partly so- and therefore must always be open to being corrected. The same goes
for the gospel communicator's understanding of the hearer's context, which can also benefit from more insight and correction.

Many Christians seeking to preach the gospel to a new culture are simply unwilling or unable to deal with this issue; they believe their task is simply to carry biblical doctrine over
the bridge into the new culture. In other words, they see gospel communication as a one way bridge. They do not like the idea that information must come over the bridge in the
other direction. They don't see its importance, or they see this as a threat to the authority of Scripture. The problem with this idea of mission is that it assumes we who are on one
side of the bridge already have an undistorted grasp of the gospel, and that our knowledge of the culture on the other side is not important. This view is blind to the truth that we are
not only sinful but also finite, and therefore we cannot have clear and exhaustive knowledge of anything. We are largely oblivious to the power of culture to shape our understanding of
things.2

So how can we guard the authority and integrity of Scripture and remain open to being corrected in our understanding of it? How can our message to the new culture be both
faithful and fruitful? The answer is to allow some two-way traffic on the bridge. 

When we approach the biblical text, we come with a "pre-understanding," a set of already established beliefs about the subjects addressed in the Bible. These beliefs are strong and deep, and many are tacit — that is, they are difficult to verbalize, formulate, or even recognize
in oneself.3 They come from a variety of voices we have listened to within our own culture. This does not mean we cannot or have not arrived at a sufficient and true understanding of
biblical teaching. But it does mean the process is not a simple one, for our existing beliefs - many of them virtually unconscious - make it difficult for us to read Scripture rightly, to let
it correct our thinking, and to carry it faithfully over the bridge to someone who needs it.

Because of our cultural blinders, we must not only speak to the people over the bridge; we must listen to them as well. We need to listen to what they are saying and take seriously their
questions, their objections to what we are saying, and their hopes and aspirations. More often than not, this interaction with a new culture shows us many things taught in the Bible -
things we either missed altogether or thought unimportant, possibly even ways in which we misread the Bible through the lens of our own cultural assumptions.

When I was a professor at Westminster Seminary in Philadelphia, many of my students had traveled from Korea to study in our school. I often led case study seminars that discussed
real-life ministry situations with both Korean and Anglo-American students. Despite the fact that all the students shared the same conservative Reformed theology, they approached
ministry in very different ways. One of the key differences had to do with how my Asian students wielded and regarded human authority. Koreans cede far more power to pastors
and fathers, while American culture is much more egalitarian and democratic. The Korean students were able to point out to American students that there is quite a lot in the Bible
about the authority of civil magistrates, parents, elders, and ministers, which Americans tend to ignore or screen out because our culture is deeply suspicious of institutions and
authority. But while Korean students could point to texts such as Romans 13 and Hebrews 13:17, American students could point Asian colleagues to passages such as Matthew 20:24 -
28 and 1 Peter 5:1-4 (warning against leaders "lording it over" others) or Acts 4:19 and 5:29 (telling us we must not let human authority usurp God's) or the book of Revelation (in which
human authority overreaches and becomes demonic).4

What was happening? Information was going back and forth over the bridge. Our interaction with a different culture leads us to ask the text questions we may never have
asked it before and to see many things we didn't see clearly before. Entering into the text
