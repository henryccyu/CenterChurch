# Chapter 11 THE TENSION OF THE CITY

Many Christians today, especially in the United States, are indifferent or even hostile toward cities. Some think of them as a negative force that undermines belief and morality, while others see them as inconsequential to Christian mission and living. It may also be true that some young Christians are adopting a romanticized view of the city.¹ But the attitude of the biblical authors is quite different. The biblical view of cities is neither hostile nor romantic. Because the city is humanity intensified — a magnifying glass that brings out the very best and worst of human nature — it has a dual nature.2

This is why the Bible depicts cities as places of perversion and violence and also as places of refuge and peace. Genesis 4 and 11 depict city builders as those in the line of Cain (the first murderer). Genesis also depicts the evil of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Yet Psalm 107 speaks of a group of wandering people "finding no way to a city where they could settle... and their lives ebbed away. Then they cried out to the Lord... He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle. Let them give thanks to the Lord” (vv. 4–8). The psalmist depicts life for people without a city as a bad thing. 

The assumption behind this psalm is that the city is a place where human life thrives — it is a positive social form. The depiction of the city in the Bible is therefore finely nuanced. It highlights how the capacities of this positive social form can be realized for God's glory yet also demonstrates how it can be a vehicle for enhancing human rebellion against God. And as we will see in chapter 12, the city plays a pivotal role in the arc of redemptive history.

In this chapter I want to look at this tension between the city's God-exalting promise and its man-exalting shadow. We will find this dual nature played out in the pages of Scripture and mirrored in our contemporary world, for in most ways our cities are still today as they have always been.

## THE CITY DEFINED
But first we must ask: What do we mean by a city? Today, a city is usually defined in terms of population size. Large population centers are called "cities," smaller ones "towns," and the smallest "villages." We must be careful, however, not to impose our current cultural understanding of city onto the biblical term. The most common Hebrew word for city, ir, meant any human settlement surrounded by some fortification or wall.3 Most ancient cities numbered only about one thousand to three thousand in population but the residents were tightly packed within the city wall. Therefore, according to the Bible, the essence of a city was not the population's size but its density. A city is a social form in which people physically live in close proximity to one another.
