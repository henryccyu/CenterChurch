# Chapter 12 REDEMPTION AND THE CITY

As we saw in the last chapter, God unexpectedly calls Israel to serve the pagan city of Babylon - to seek its prosperity-while living in exile there. And in a sense, the people of God have yet to return from that state of exile. In this chapter, we will see how this exilic model helps us understand the relationship of the church to the city in New Testament times, and even today —
and how God plans to resolve the great tension of the city at the end of time.¹

During the exile, Israel no longer existed in the form of a nation-state with a government and laws. Instead, it existed as a countercultural fellowship contained within other nation- states. In many ways, this is also the form of the New Testament church, as Peter and James suggest when they address believers as "the Dispersion" (Jas 1:1 ESV) and "exiles" (1 Pet 1:1 ESV). Twice Peter uses parepidemoi as a word for "exiles"—a word we sometimes translate as "resident aliens." Parepidemoi were citizens of one country and yet full-time residents of another. Their
primary allegiance was to another country, and that country's culture was formative for their beliefs and practices. Yet they lived in their country of residence as full participants in its life. In other words, "resident aliens" lived neither as natives nor as tourists. Though they were not permanently rooted, neither were they merely travelers who were just passing through.

> ### RESIDENT ALIENS AND CULTURE
>
> In an article on 1 Peter titled "Soft Difference," Miroslav Volf shows how the tension Peter envisioned between persecution and attraction and between evangelism and service does not fit neatly into any of the historic models of relating Christ to culture. Unlike models that call for a transformation of culture or a Christendom-like alliance of church
and state, Peter expects the gospel to always be highly offensive and never completely embraced or accepted by the world. This is a caution to those Christians who hope to bring about an essentially Christian culture. And unlike models that call solely for evangelism and are highly pessimistic about influencing culture, Peter nonetheless expects
some aspects of Christian faith and practice to be highly attractive in any pagan culture, thus influencing people to praise God.2

Christians are now considered citizens of "the Jerusalem that is above" (Gal 4:26; see Phil 3:20). Indeed, in a significant statement, Jesus tells his followers that they are a "city on a hill" (Matt 5:14). Communities of Christ-followers are God's "city" within every earthly city. They are the renewed people of God (see Isa 32:14; Dan 9:16). Their ultimate allegiance belongs to God and his kingdom, yet, in keeping with the term used by Peter and James, believers are not just "passing through" their earthly cities. This reflects the same balanced attitude that Jewish
exiles were called to have toward Babylon. The Jewish exiles were not to hate the pagan city as they bided their time, waiting for the day of their departure. They were to be fully involved in its life, working in it and praying for it. At the same time, they were not to adopt its culture or lose their distinctive identity as God's holy people. God called the Jewish exiles to accept and embrace
the tension of the city for the sake of God's glory — and this is exactly what today's Christians are called to do as well.

Resident aliens will always live with both praise and misunderstanding. Jesus taught that Christians' "good deeds" are to be visible to the pagans (Matt 5:16), but he also warns his followers to expect misunderstanding and persecution (v. 10). In a similar way, Peter calls Christians to live in the midst of pagan society in such a way that others will see their "good deeds and glorify God" (1 Pet 2:12), but he warns them to expect persecution nonetheless. Both Peter and Jesus indicate that these "good deeds" (which in the Greek meant not merely personal morality but also acts of service to others) will lead at least some pagans to glorify God.

Despite these similarities, the Christian church differs from the Jewish exiles in two significant ways. First, the Jews "increase in number" in Babylon almost exclusively by having children and growing families (Jer 29:6). The church must also multiply and increase in the pagan city as God's new humanity, but this happens especially through evangelism and discipling (Acts 6:1, 7; 9:31; 12:24). We also see a significant shift in God's call to mission between the Old and New Testaments. In the Old Testament, mission was centripetal; the flow was in toward the center. Israel was called to be an obedient people, becoming a society that displayed God's glory for the nations to see (Deut 4:6-8). The nations were called to look and to "come in" and worship God. But in the New Testament, mission becomes centrifugal — moving outward from the center. The people of God are sent out to the world to proclaim the gospel (Matt 28:16-20; Acts 1-2). The Babylonian exile and Jonah's mission are foreshadowings of this future change.

Second, despite their engagement with Babylonian society, the Jews still kept the Mosaic code, so that their dress, food, and other practices continued to set them culturally apart from the Babylonians (see, e.g., Dan 1:8). Their dietary laws alone virtually dictated that Jews eat separately from pagans. In the book of Acts, God has to send Peter a vivid and forceful vision to get him to even consider accepting an invitation to enter a Gentile soldier's home (10:28-29). In Christ, these ceremonial and cultural regulations and distinctions become obsolete (Mark 7; Acts 15:1-35). Jesus eats with tax collectors and sinners as a strategy for ministry. Adopting these New Testament teachings frees Christians to participate in a city's culture more fully than the Jews in Babylon could. However, this freedom also makes the danger of assimilation and compromise more acute for Christians. As future citizens of heaven, Christians must see and avoid the idolatries and injustices of their culture, even as they continue to enjoy its common-grace blessings.

So why should we apply the exhortations of Jeremiah 29 to the church today? In the Bible, we see the people of God living in three configurations. From Abraham's day onward, God's people existed as an extended biological family. From the days of Moses, they existed as a nation-state, with laws and a king and an army to enforce those laws by civil sanctions. During the exile, however, God's people existed as a dispersed fellowship of congregations (synagogues) living in many different nation-states. God's laws did not take a civil form during that period - the disobedient were expelled from the congregation, but they were not executed.

> ### JONAH'S MISSION
>
> The book of Jonah foreshadows the centrifugal New Testament mission (sending believers out) rather than the centripetal Old Testament mission (calling nonbelievers in).
Jonah is the only Old Testament prophet sent to a pagan city to call it to repentance. God's final statement is striking. The Lord calls Jonah to love the great pagan city of Nineveh because of the vast number of its spiritually blind inhabitants (Jonah 4:10-11).3

> ### THE "CRUCIALITY" OF CITY MINISTRY IN THE BIBLE
>
> Many of the reasons that city ministry was so effective in the early church have been outlined by Wayne Meeks in The First Urban Christians and by Harvie Conn in his many books. They identify three "crucial" factors:
1. Cultural cruciality. In the village, someone might win its one or two lawyers to Christ. However, if you want to win the legal profession, which will influence all lawyers, you must go to the city, where you will find the law schools and the law journal publishers—the key institutions of influence in that profession.
2. Global cruciality. In the village, someone can win over the single people group living there, since rural areas are often sociologically homogeneous. But if you share the gospel in a city, you can reach dozens of different national and ethnic groups. Indeed, you can reach them through one language—the lingua franca of that place. The gospel then travels back into many different cultures through immigrants who return to visit or remain in their homelands.
3. Personal cruciality. In the village, people live in a culture that tends to resist change and is more conservative and traditional. However, because of the diversity and mobility of the cities, urbanites are more open to new ideas—such as the gospel! The pressure and diversity of the city environment make even the most gospel-hostile people open to new ways of thinking and living.
