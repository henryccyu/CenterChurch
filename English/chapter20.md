# chapter 20 CENTERING THE MISSIONAL CHURCH
Though a clear and valuable benefit exists in identifying the common ground of the missional church, the range of differences among various definitions and viewpoints is great, and many
aspects of the visions for "missional living” contradict each other. Everyone involved in the missional conversation concludes that others are making significant errors, and I am no different
in this regard. As I have observed the ongoing conversation about the missional church and tested many of these ideas as a practitioner, I have three primary concerns with the way some
segments of the missional conversation are appropriating the core insights outlined at the end of the previous chapter. We need to learn how to discern and avoid each of these problems if we
are to be effective in developing a ministry with a Center Church orientation.

PROBLEM #1: NOT COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH
First, we examine the branch of the conversation that sees the missional church as simply being evangelistic. I agree that any missional church must be pervasively, intensely evangelistic in
the common use of the word - we must call people to personal conversion. However, the typical evangelical gospel presentation is too shallow. It speaks cursorily about a God whom we have
sinned against, a Savior who died for our sins, and a call to believe in this Savior. The simplicity of this communication presumes that those listening share the same essential understanding
of the words God and sin as the speaker.
But what if a growing majority of people outside the church live by such a radically different view of life that much of what is now said and done by the Christian community is
inexplicable or even deeply offensive to them? What if many listeners hold a profoundly different understanding of the concepts of God, truth, right and wrong, freedom, virtue, and sin?
What if their approaches to reality, human nature and destiny, and human community are wholly different from our own?

For decades, this has been the situation facing Christian churches in many areas around the world — places such as India, Iran, and Japan. Evangelism in these environments involves
a lengthy process in which nonbelievers have to be invited into a Christian community that bridges the gap between Christian truth and the culture around it. Every part of a church's life —
its worship, community, public discourse, preaching, and education — has to assume the presence of nonbelievers from the surrounding culture. The aesthetics of its worship have to reflect
the sensibilities of the culture and yet show how Christian belief shapes and is expressed through them. Its preaching and teaching have to show how the hopes of this culture's people can
find fulfillment only in Christ. Most of all, such a congregation's believers have to reflect the demographic makeup of the surrounding community, thereby giving non-Christian neighbors
attractive and challenging glimpses of what they would look like as Christians.
One reason much of the evangelical church in the United States has not yet experienced the same precipitous decline as the Protestant churches of Europe and Canada is that,
unlike these places, the U.S. still includes sizable remnants of Christendom. We have places where the informal public culture (though not the formal public institutions) still stigmatizes
non-Christian beliefs and behavior. There is, according to journalist Michael Wolff, a “fundamental schism in American cultural, political, and economic life. There's the quicker-growing,
economically vibrant ... morally relativist, urban-oriented, culturally adventuresome, sexually polymorphous, and ethnically diverse nation ... And there's the small-town, nuclear-family,
religiously oriented, white-centric other America, [with] ... its diminishing cultural and economic force... two countries."1
To reach this growing post-Christendom society in the West will obviously take more than what we ordinarily call an evangelistic church; it will take a missional church. This church's
worship is missional in that it makes sense to nonbelievers in that culture, even while it challenges and shapes Christians with the gospel.2 Its people are missional in that they are so
outwardly focused, so involved in addressing the needs of the local community, that the church is well-known for its compassion. The members of a missional church also know how to
contextualize the gospel, carefully challenging yet also appealing to the baseline cultural narratives of the society around them.3 Finally, because of the attractiveness of its people's character
and lives, a missional church will always have some outsiders who are drawn into its community to incubate and explore the Christian faith in its midst.
