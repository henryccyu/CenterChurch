CENTER CHURCH BALANCES
CITY BALANCE

Center Church ministry is neither undercontextualized nor overcontextualized to the city and the culture. Because the city has potential for both human flourishing and human idolatry, we minister with balance, using the gospel to both appreciate and challenge the culture to be in accord
with God's truth.
•
. Be informed and shaped by all of Scripture all of the time — the parts that are offensive to our personal and cultural sensibilities, as well as those that are more plausible and energizing to us.
• Realize that while no truth can be articulated in a culture-transcending way, the truth does transcend culture.
. Be willing to interact with different cultures in order to come to a more rounded biblical Christianity.
⚫ Have a stance toward the city/culture that includes critical enjoyment and appropriate wariness, for it is a mix of both common grace and sin.
⚫ Confront hearers with an epistemological challenge, a personal challenge, and a proclamation of Christ.
⚫ Employ more than one type of appeal in gospel presentations - logical and existential, short-term and long-term.
• Minister with boldness and confidence as well as with humility and irony, for the gospel creates both in you at the same time.
⚫ Hold to one true gospel, yet learn to creatively adapt it in culturally specific ways.
• Actively engage the city/culture, while avoiding cultural captivity in all its forms (cultural fundamentalism and withdrawal; cultural relativism and syncretism).
⚫ Drill (affirm culture) and blast (confront culture) when you preach and teach.
• Address both "A" beliefs and doctrines and "B" beliefs and doctrines.
• Use a balance of all the atonement grammars (battlefield, marketplace, exile, temple, law court, substitution).
. See cities as a social form with the potential for both God-given purpose and self-centered rebellion against God.
• Live as both residents and foreigners in this world.
• Emphasize the goodness of secular vocation and the importance of building up the church.
• Take a view of cultural engagement that is informed by the whole of the biblical story line so that it is neither too pessimistic nor too optimistic about the possibility for cultural change and so that it affirms the presence of both common grace and pervasive sin in every
culture.
. "Seek the center" by incorporating the key biblical insights of each Christ-and-culture model, where there is a greater reliance on the whole cloth of biblical themes - creation and fall, natural and special revelation, curse and common grace, the "already but not yet,"
continuity and discontinuity, sin and grace.
• Realize that your preferred model for relating the church to culture is the product of external forces (theological commitments) and internal forces (temperament and spiritual gifts).
⚫ Understand the mission of the church in both institutional and organic terms.
