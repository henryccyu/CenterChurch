# Chapter 13 THE CALL TO THE CITY
保罗和其他基督教传教士会前往大城市，是因为一旦基督教在这些地方扎根，它就会向周边地区传播（城市是交通路线的枢纽）；也会向全球扩展（城市是多种族、国际化的中心，而归信者会将福音带回自己的家乡）；最后，它也更容易影响文化（城市是教育、法律和政府的中心）。正如我们将在本章中看到的，城市在当今基督教宣教中的重要性，如果有变化的话，只会更为显著。

如今，城市比以往任何时候都更加重要。1950年，只有纽约和伦敦这两个世界级城市的人口超过了一千万。然而，如今已有超过二十座这样的城市——其中有十二座是在过去二十年中达到这一规模的——而且还会有更多。¹ 所有这些新兴的特大城市都出现在曾被称为“第三世界”的地区。但为什么会这样呢？

18世纪，人口增长与技术发展相结合，使得欧洲农村达到了其“承载极限”，从而产生了过剩人口。几乎所有的土地都已被拥有和开发，因此每个家庭中总会有一些成员离开家庭农场、乡村和小镇，前往其他地方谋生。结果，欧洲的大城市（19世纪则是美国）迅速膨胀。许多专家现在认为，类似的转变已经开始在非洲、亚洲，甚至在某种程度上也出现在拉丁美洲发生，那里的城市正迅速涌入大量来自农村的人口。如果这些地区的城乡人口比例最终稳定在约75%对25%（如同欧洲和北美那样），那么在接下来的三十年里，仅非洲和亚洲就将有超过五亿人迁入城市——换句话说，相当于每两个月就诞生一个新的里约热内卢（一千万人口）。² 目前，像纽约这样的西方城市每年人口增长大约为12.5万人，而像达卡（Dhaka）和拉各斯（Lagos）这样的城市，每年的增长速度超过五十万人。根据大多数估算，如今全球已有超过50%的人口居住在城市，而两百年前，这一比例仅为约5%。³

## GLOBALIZATION AND RENAISSANCE
当今城市的重要性不仅体现在它们日益增长的规模上，更在于其日益增强的影响力，而这种影响力源于全球化的兴起。科技革命带来了前所未有的人口、思想和资本的流动性。由于互联网和其他电子通信形式的出现，世界各地的人们比以往任何时候都更加紧密地联系在一起，尤其是西方城市文化正在全球范围内迅速传播。

这种由于全球化导致的“世界平坦化”现象带来了什么影响呢？  
首先，全球化使城市与世界相连。曾有人预测技术的发展最终会削弱城市的重要性，使“聚集效应”（通常是由不同元素构成的集中群体）变得过时。人们认为社交网络和在线通信可以让人们无需承受城市高昂的生活成本。但正如埃德温·希思科特（Edwin Heathcote）所写：“数字网络并没有像人们预测的那样导致城市衰退，反而使整个地球城市化了。”如今的人们，尤其是年轻人，渴望生活在城市中。新型技术和流动性的兴起并没有削弱这一愿望，反而极大地扩大了城市文化的影响范围。这种城市化的影响远远超出了城市本身的范围，甚至波及到偏远国家最乡村的地区。墨西哥和罗马尼亚的孩子们，正在变得比他们自己本地的成年人更像洛杉矶和纽约的年轻人。

第二，全球化让城市彼此相连。全球化不仅将世界其他地方与城市的理念和文化联系起来，也让城市之间形成了紧密的网络，增强了它们的力量和影响力。世界城市之间的联系甚至比它们与本国的联系还要紧密。纽约、伦敦、东京的精英阶层不仅在同一家跨国公司工作，还往往毕业于相同的高等学府，在同样的地方度假、购置房产，分享着共同的社会与文化价值观。他们与其他国家的城市精英的认同感，往往强过对自己国家农村居民的认同。

不过，这些主要城市之间的强大联系不仅仅存在于精英阶层中。全球城市中庞大而多样化的移民人口，使每一个城市都与数十个其他国家紧密相连。他们频繁往返，日常与祖国家乡保持联系。这意味着，例如，纽约的成千上万居民与雅典、马尼拉、太子港、波哥大、香港和拉各斯的人们之间的联系，比他们与新泽西或康涅狄格州的居民还要紧密。每一座全球城市，都是通向其他国家的门户。

这些网络化的世界城市正在迅速在经济和文化影响力上超越本国政府。各国政府越来越难以控制资本和信息的流动，其影响力远远不如总部设于全球城市中的跨国公司和国际金融、社会、科技网络。美国记者尼尔·皮尔斯（Neal Peirce）指出：“真正开始崛起为世界最具影响力角色的，不是城市，不是州，甚至不是民族国家，而是大型都市区域。”⁸

城市不仅会发展和成熟，也可以实现重生。尽管在20世纪末西方城市曾遭遇一波悲观的浪潮，但许多城市在1990年代和21世纪初期实现了复兴。1970到1990这二十年间，许多美国城市经历了急剧衰退。非裔美国人从南方迁移至北方城市，引发了白人搬离（白人逃离），大量贫困人口被困在市中心的贫民窟中。1970年代末和1980年代初的长期经济衰退使得税收减少，有些城市甚至濒临或陷入破产。同时，20世纪中叶的城市规划偏向郊区发展。整个城市街区被夷为平地，用于建设高速公路，以方便郊区居民进入市中心工作。规划者还偏爱大型商场和拥有大量停车位的体育场馆，以及为贫困人口兴建的大型住房项目。这一切导致市中心在夜晚变成“鬼城”。中产阶级逃往郊区，也将大量就业岗位带走，使贫困者更加贫困，大多数社区犯罪猖獗。城市中空成“甜甜圈”：中心是贫穷的有色人种聚集区，外围则是富裕的白人郊区。

然而，自1990年以来，美国城市经历了一场惊人的复兴。² 在这段时间里，许多城市的人口下降趋势开始逆转。人们开始回流城市，城市中心开始重建和再生。为什么会这样？  
第一，原因之一是这段时期美国经济经历了持续增长，带来了大量新财富和知识领域的新工作机会。  
第二，城市犯罪率下降，部分原因是自由派认为的“就业机会增加”，也有保守派强调的“执法更严厉”。  
第三，一种文化氛围逐渐形成（有些人称之为“后现代”），这种氛围欣赏多样性、旧与新的混合、不对称、混乱与不可控、文化多元以及艺术性和有机性。这些都是城市生活的特征，而非郊区文化所体现的。年轻一代开始更偏爱城市生活，纷纷迁入城市。  
第四，移民法的改变打开了非欧洲国家移民的大门。1965到1970年间，美国移民人数翻倍。接着从1970到1990年又翻了一倍。这波移民潮的大多数人涌入了美国城市，更新并多样化了许多社区。这也彻底改变了原本僵化的黑人-白人二元城市政治格局，转变为一个更加复杂、多极化、由多种族群和国籍组成的局面。

> **COMEBACK: MINNEAPOLIS AND MILAN**
> 爱德华·格雷泽（Edward Glaeser）举了两个成功转型的城市例子：美国明尼苏达州的明尼阿波利斯（Minneapolis）和意大利的米兰（Milan）。
>
> 1950 到 1980 年间，明尼阿波利斯失去了 30% 的人口，而它的地理位置和气候条件似乎并不具备城市复兴的优势。过去，该城市通过靠近河岸的位置来吸引人力资源，但这一优势已不再有吸引力。然而，自 1980 年以来，明尼阿波利斯的人口不断增长，如今成为美国中西部地区人均收入最高的城市之一。为什么？因为它将自己重新定位为教育中心。该市是明尼苏达大学（University of Minnesota）的所在地，“该市最引人注目的经济成功案例几乎都与这所学校有关。”10 其中一个例子就是美敦力公司（Medtronic），全球最大的医疗技术公司。
>
> 米兰曾是一个制造业巨头，但它也遭遇了类似导致美国“铁锈地带”衰退的经济冲击。1970 年至 2000 年间，米兰的人口减少了将近 30%。然而，米兰成功转型，如今该市 75% 的就业人口从事服务业，主要集中于金融，同时涵盖医疗与生物科技、电信、零售以及时尚产业。过去十年间，米兰的人口持续增长。11

随着这些变化，许多美国城市开始重新崛起。专业人士涌入城市中心区域，新的族裔社群也在旧的工人阶级和贫困社区中逐步形成。有时，城市更新（gentrification）对社区的社会结构造成了破坏和动荡；但在其他情况下，它带来了更正面的影响。此次城市复兴浪潮的主要参与者包括：返回城市的“空巢”婴儿潮一代、寻求城市生活与工作的年轻专业人士，以及居住在城市贫民区和内城区郊区的新移民群体——这些移民的下一代往往是大学毕业生，随后选择回到城市中心生活和工作。这些群体与一直选择居住在城市的同性恋者和艺术家们汇聚在一起，成为推动城市复兴的重要力量。12

爱德华·格雷泽指出，并非所有城市在过去这一代中都取得了成功，例如密歇根州的底特律（Detroit）和德国的莱比锡（Leipzig）就是失败的例子。但他认为，大多数城市之所以能够实现自我重塑，是因为城市的本质就是将人们聚集在一起进行创新。从某个层面来看，这意味着聚集最受过良好教育、最具才华的“精英”人士；但从另一个层面来说，也意味着将全球范围内最有活力、最具雄心和冒险精神的中产阶级和贫困群体聚集到一起。城市是“重塑”与“再造”的熔炉，因此城市不断自我更新并不令人意外。

当代城市转型中最有趣的例子之一，就是所谓的“消费型城市”（consumer city）。二战之后，美国兴起郊区化浪潮，城市变成了“通勤城市”（commuter city）：人们为了舒适的生活选择搬到郊区，只有在上班或偶尔的演出时才会进入城市。而温哥华和洛杉矶却逆势而行，成为了“消费型城市”，出现了一种新的现象——“反向通勤族”（reverse commuter）。这些城市及其他一些地区开始为居民提供该地区其他地方无法比拟的生活质量：丰富的艺术、教育、文化和娱乐活动场所，以及（如今）安全的街道、优质的学校和高效的公共交通系统。如今，许多人搬到伦敦、纽约和巴黎居住，哪怕他们的工作地点在城市核心以外，也愿意支付高额租金住在城市中心。13

## THE FUTURE OF CITIES
如今，很少有人相信全球城市的人口增长和重要性在可预见的未来会出现显著下降。这种增长趋势和文化转变的势头过于强劲。然而，美国和欧洲的经济大衰退以及艰难的经济形势，意味着这些国家的城市政府被迫对预算进行大幅、痛苦的削减，而私营部门则面临多年高失业率的前景。许多城市在社会服务方面的差距可能会进一步扩大。这些变化势必会影响城市的生活质量。14

那么，西方城市是否会重返 1970 和 1980 年代那种经济与人口双双衰退的状态呢？有几个趋势很可能帮助西方的许多城市在可预见的未来继续繁荣。

首先，全球化将持续推进，而全球化对能够与之接轨的城市而言，是一种福音。越来越多的城市会效仿西方最具代表性的国际大都市，如纽约、洛杉矶和伦敦——它们强大的国际联系与影响力，有助于维持房产价值并提供稳定的就业来源（无论本国经济表现如何）。因此，大多数融入全球化的城市应当能够保持经济稳定。

第二，当前西方城市的城市规划重新回归经典的城市形态——紧凑型、以公共交通为导向、适合步行的混合用途开发（住宅、商业、零售、教育、文化机构和娱乐场所集中分布）。这种模式强调建设本地社区学校、“完整街道”（具有人行道）和自行车道。这种对传统城市形态的回归，常被称为“新城市主义”（New Urbanism）或“智慧增长”（Smart Growth）。推动这一趋势的因素有很多，其中一个与环境问题有关。郊区和乡村居民的能源消耗——包括电力、化石燃料等——远远高于城市居民。15 对能源可持续性的日益迫切追求，将继续促使社会走向城市化。因此，作为一种社会组织形式，城市将持续成为郊区之外极具吸引力的替代方案。

第三，至本文撰写之时，美国的移民法律并未发生重大变化，因此很可能美国仍将继续从全球各地接收移民。尽管有些趋势显示部分移民直接进入郊区生活，但城市生活的结构依然为多数新移民提供了融入新社会所需的关键支持资源。如今，城市将争相吸引移民，因为吸纳最多移民的城市将在未来处于最有利的发展地位。

> **THERE REALLY IS NO CHOICE**
> 美国南方浸信会神学院院长艾尔·莫勒（Al Mohler）读了《金融时报》2010年的特别报道《城市的未来》（The Future of Cities），并以强烈的语气作出回应：
> 
> “有一点是明确的：城市是人群所在之地。在不到三百年的时间里，我们的世界将从一个只有 3% 人口居住在城市中的社会，转变为一个 80% 的人口居住在城市地区的世界。”
> 
> “如果基督教会不能学会新的城市事工模式，我们就会发现自己被排除在外，只能在边缘观望。耶稣基督的福音必须呼召新一代忠心的基督徒走进这些熙熙攘攘的城市。正如这些新数据所显示的，我们真的别无选择。”<sup>16</sup>

**第四点**，人们对城市最大的恐惧之一——即在大型城市中不可避免的高犯罪率和生命威胁——正在迅速减弱。在纽约市的带领下，北美许多城市在过去二十年间见证了令人震惊的犯罪率下降；这正是推动城市经济和人口增长的主要因素之一。纽约市市长迈克尔·布隆伯格曾声称，这种下降完全归功于更好的警务制度。<sup>17</sup> 但犯罪学家指出，警务只能解释一部分下降，犯罪率的显著下降往往是多种因素共同作用的结果，其中许多因素无法直接衡量。<sup>18</sup> 这些因素可能包括“公民社会”的加强——例如家长教师联盟的增强、宗教机构的发展、各种非营利组织的增长，以及公私合作的增强等。<sup>19</sup>

**第五点**，据我观察，后现代的文化氛围导致许多年轻人偏好城市生活胜于郊区生活，而这种趋势仍将持续。这种趋势难以量化，也难以完全解释，但城市生活对年轻人仍具有极大吸引力，而年轻人的活力与创造力将继续支撑城市的成长与活力。《华尔街日报》和《大西洋月刊》报道称，大约有 32% 的“千禧一代”美国人居住在城市里——而其中有 88% 表示他们想住在城市。<sup>20</sup>

一些问题严重的城市，如底特律，确实需要进行彻底的改变，缩小城市规模，重新规划成更小的自治体。但这不太可能成为美国的普遍趋势。我相信，全球化以及当前的文化氛围将继续使城市成为雄心勃勃、富有创新精神之人追求的目的地，这将是推动城市文化持续增长与主导地位的决定性因素。

**如今，比以往任何时候都更加明显，城市正在为整个社会和生活设定方向**，即使是在像欧洲和北美这样的城市增长速度放缓的地区也是如此。<sup>21</sup> 所有现有迹象都表明，**21 世纪的世界秩序将是全球化的、多元文化的，以及城市化的。**

## THE CHALLENGE OF MINISTRY IN CITIES
当今城市的巨大增长和影响力，给基督教宣教带来了极大的挑战。首要的问题就是规模和经济层面的问题。重要的是，无论人在哪里，我们都应当有基督徒和教会的存在，但如今人们迁入全球大城市的速度远远快于教会的步伐。基督教的传播和事工必须不断适应新的语言和文化环境，但教会的回应速度远不及城市人口增长的速度。

目前，每个月大约有 **五百万人**迁入发展中世界的城市——这个数字相当于费城或旧金山这样一个大都市区的人口。想一想：在像费城这样规模的城市中，应该有多少间教会？即便我们按每五千人有一间教会来计算——这已是美国平均水平的五分之一<sup>22</sup>——那也意味着我们每个月应该在世界范围内建立 **一千间城市教会**。

然而，这一挑战不仅仅是数量上的，也涉及到观念和方法论。我们的事工模式本身也必须逐步城市化。美国的宣教机构越来越发现，他们必须把工人差派到日益扩大的城市中去生活和服事。但这些美国宣教士很少有城市生活或城市事工的经验。几年前，我遇到了一些被派往中国快速增长的大城市的美国宣教士。他们告诉我，他们的差会认为他们只需要学习语言和了解中国文化。然而过了一段时间，他们意识到自己完全不懂如何在城市中生活。他们团队的每位成员都成长于美国南部或中西部的小镇。他们面临的最大挑战不是“中国文化”，而是“城市生活”。他们后来也意识到，他们试图接触的人群其实更像生活在洛杉矶或曼哈顿的人，而不像中国乡村的人。团队的负责人对我说：“除了语言训练之外，其他培训几乎没有帮助。我们没有接受任何关于如何在城市中生活、如何接触城市人群的训练，结果我们的事工几乎毫无成效。”

**城市化**不仅正在改变西方对海外宣教的方式，它也正在改变**西方本地的宣教图景**。来自南半球和东半球的移民正不断涌入北美和欧洲的城市。其中很多移民来自基督信仰正在兴旺的地区。结果，在伦敦、巴黎和纽约等原本日趋世俗化的城市中，成千上万间新教会由非西方人创立。<sup>23</sup> 事实上，伦敦和巴黎许多规模最大、出席人数最多的教会由非洲人带领，而在纽约，我们也见证了成百上千间由亚洲、拉丁美洲、加勒比和非洲基督徒所建立的新教会。一开始，这些教会往往在族裔社群中传福音、成长，与主流社会较为隔离。但随着这些基督徒的下一代进入本国大学接受教育，并迁入市中心生活，他们开始在金融、媒体和文化领域拥有越来越大的影响力。西方主流阶层开始邀请这些年轻的有色人种进入商业与政府的高层，却并未意识到他们中很大一部分其实是虔诚的基督徒。<sup>24</sup>

**全球化与城市化**正在消除“本土宣教”与“海外宣教”之间的界限（暂且用这个传统术语来说明）<sup>25</sup>。比如，我认识纽约皇后区的一间教会。他们差派了三间“分堂”：一间在纽约市的邻近社区 College Point，一间在布朗克斯，另一间在“邻近”的菲律宾。他们在本地接触了大量菲律宾移民，这些新信徒渴望在自己的祖国朋友和亲属中建立教会，于是他们从纽约差派了一大群人去菲律宾植堂。这并不是个案。如今每一座大城市都是接触万国的门户。换句话说，**接触你所在城市，就是接触世界的一种极佳方式！**<sup>26</sup>

再举一个例子。我们在纽约市中心曼哈顿建立了救赎主长老教会（Redeemer Presbyterian Church）。几年之内，我们就在纽约州的威彻斯特县和新泽西州（这两个是纽约的主要“通勤郊区”）建立了分堂。如果我们最初是在任何一个郊区设立教会，我们几乎不可能在这么短的时间内植堂到曼哈顿或其他郊区。为什么？因为你无法从郊区有效接触城市，但你**可以从城市接触郊区**。城市就像一颗巨大的心脏，将人吸引进来，再送出去。学生为了上学来到城市，毕业后离开；单身者在城市中相识、结婚，有了孩子后搬去郊区；移民最初生活在城市的族裔聚居区，积累财富、适应社会后，为了更大的居住空间，也会迁往外圈。每一个例子中，人们的运动都是**由中心向外扩展**。因此，一间在城市中兴盛的教会，将自然形成一个成员会扩散至周边地区和其他大城市的社群。换句话说，**接触一个地区或国家的最佳方式之一，就是首先接触你所在的城市！**

> **ONE OF HISTORY’S GREATEST OPPORTUNITIES**
> 城市在将福音传给难以触及的人群方面，可能发挥极其重大的作用。这是宣教士兼神学家罗杰·格林威（Roger Greenway）的看法：

> “对那些对城市抱有疑虑的人来说……也许有帮助的是去思想这样一个事实：城市化作为当今人类大多数人所处的现实生活状态，其背后是在上帝的护理之下。《使徒行传》17:26-27中，使徒保罗指出：‘他从一本造出万族的人，住在全地上，并且预先定准他们的年限和所住的疆界。要叫他们寻求神，或者可以揣摩而得。’从这段经文的角度来看，城市的增长不应被视为全然出于魔鬼的作为，而是神在历史中护理计划的一部分。神对城市增长的救赎目的就是：‘要叫人寻求他，或者可以揣摩而得……’”
>
> 如今，各族、各支派和多元人群被聚集在大都市中，从地理上来看，比以往任何时候都更加容易接触。有时候，那些新城市居民在适应城市生活的过程中，会变得对福音更加开放。若真如此，全球城市化应当从**末世论**与**宣教**的双重视角来看。神正在我们这个时代通过各种社会、政治、经济因素戏剧性地动工，使地上的万民彼此更紧密地接触，增强互动与互赖，并更加容易听见福音的声音。通过这场运动，神正在推动他在历史中的救赎计划。我们这个时代的标志就是——城市。透过全球人口向城市的迁徙，神或许正在为基督教宣教最伟大、甚至可能是最后的时刻搭建舞台。<sup>27</sup>

## THE OPPORTUNITY OF MINISTRY IN CITIES
当今城市规模和影响力的增长，为教会带来了前所未有的巨大挑战。学习如何在城市中有效地开展事工从未像现在这样重要，然而，总体而言，美国的福音派基督教仍然不是以城市为中心的。

然而，伴随这些挑战而来的，还有一系列独特的机会。我看到有四类关键人群必须被触及，才能完成教会的使命，而这四类人群都最容易在城市中被触及：

### 年轻的一代  
晋升的机会、不断创新和变化的氛围、多元影响和人群的聚集——这一切都吸引着年轻的成年人。在美国和欧洲，年轻人普遍更想住在城市里；而对于那些有强烈抱负的年轻人，这个比例更高。大卫·布鲁克斯（David Brooks）在《纽约时报》的一篇专栏《我梦想着丹佛》中引用皮尤研究中心的数据，指出年轻人与年长者在城市偏好上的显著差异：

> “城市对年轻人仍然具有吸引力。在18到34岁的美国人中，有45%希望住在纽约市。但城市对有家庭的人和老年人却极具排斥力。只有14%的35岁以上美国人对居住在纽约感兴趣，而65岁以上的人中只有8%被洛杉矶吸引。”<sup>28</sup>

这意味着，如果西方教会仍主要扎根于美国中部的郊区，忽视那些大城市，它就有可能失去整整一代美国社会的未来领袖。

城市里之所以充满年轻人，部分原因是学生众多。在大学城里，学生的存在显而易见；而在大城市中，虽然本科生和研究生数量庞大，但由于城市人口的多样和庞杂，学生的存在感变得不那么突出。然而，学生依旧是极为重要的宣教禾场，并且城市中的大学生毕业后拥有远多于大学城学生的本地就业机会。因此，在城市中归信基督的大学生，未来也会成为城市教会的重要领袖资源。

### “文化精英”  
第二类人群是文化精英——他们对社会的生活方式有着不成比例的影响力，因为他们在商业、出版、媒体、学术界和艺术领域拥有权势。这些人通常居住在城市中心，或者至少将大量时间花在城市中。如今，城市比以往任何时候都更深刻地影响着全球的文化和价值观，因此，基督徒若要对一个国家的文化产生影响，最有效的方式莫过于让大批信徒留在城市中，在那里“成为教会”。此外，正如前文所述，在世界级大城市中有效的事工模式是可以“输出”的——它们往往比乡村事工更具可移植性。一个在美国乡村有效的牧养方式，未必适用于其他国家的乡村；但一种在某个中心城市有效的事工形式，很可能也能在其他中心城市中产生广泛共鸣，尤其是在年轻一代当中。

一些基督徒会抱怨说：“我们在文化战中节节败退。”这其实是因为，那些居住在城市中的小规模群体，对文化的影响远远超过居住在城市之外的福音派基督徒。我每次从曼哈顿42街地铁站出来时，都会经过维亚康母公司（Viacom）的总部——它是MTV的母公司。很少有机构像MTV那样对整整一代人产生如此深远的文化影响。我曾读过一篇文章，说多年的共产统治都未能消除罗马尼亚境内匈牙利少数民族的民族认同感，但如今全球青少年文化却正在让匈牙利的年轻人脱离他们的文化根基。全球消费型青年文化正从曼哈顿和好莱坞源源不断地被输送到全世界孩子们的数码设备上。如今，即便是墨西哥乡村的十五岁少年，在感官和意识形态上也比他们的父母“更加城市化”。如果教会希望影响那些创造出像MTV这样的机构的人群，就必须在他们生活的地方生活并服事——也就是城市。

### 可接触的“未得之民”  
许多人强调，要向那些难以触及的宗教或文化群体传福音，这些群体可能居住在偏远地区或生活在禁止基督教宣教的国家。然而，历史的潮流正将这些昔日难以接触的人们卷入城市中——因农村经济已难以维持他们原有的生活方式。

数以百万计的新移民涌入快速发展的城市中，他们在新环境下往往比在原来的文化背景中更开放于基督信仰。他们大多已经脱离了自己熟悉的传统环境，离开了他们原先所依靠的亲属和部落网络，而许多发展中国家的城市几乎“没有任何正常运作的政府服务”<sup>29</sup>。这些新移民面临道德、经济、情感和灵性上的巨大压力，而这正是教会服事的契机——提供一个支持性的群体，一个属灵的新家庭，以及一则使人得释放的福音信息。城市移民有很多理由开始参加教会活动，这些理由在他们的乡村生活中是不存在的。正如一位学者所说：“任何能够同时满足这些新城市居民身体和心灵需要的群体，都会收获丰硕的成果。”<sup>31</sup>

### 城市使“未得之民”变得更可触及的另一种方式  
正如前面提到的，随着科技的发展，城市心态正在全球蔓延，年轻一代越来越多地与都市化、全球化的“超文化”接轨。即便在偏远地区的年轻人，也正在变成半个“全球化西方人”，而他们的父母依然固守传统的思维方式。因此，那些原本专为城市居民设计的事工方式与福音沟通方法，如今也越来越适用于非城市地区的年轻人，且效果显著。

> **MOVING TO THE CITY**
> 在《两个城市，两种爱》中，詹姆斯·蒙哥马利·博伊斯（James Montgomery Boice）提到尼希米记11章1节中为了重新填满耶路撒冷而抽签派遣1/10人民的比例，并提出在美国这种非农业社会中，这个比例理应更高。他的观点是：如果全国更多的基督徒有意识地搬到大城市中，在那里活出爱、真理和仆人式的生命，那么整个文化将被根本性地改变。<sup>30</sup>

### 穷人  
第四类可以并且必须在城市中被触及的人群是贫困者。一些研究估计，在发展中世界的新城市增长人口中，有三分之一将生活在棚户区。世界上大多数的穷人都生活在城市，而接触城市精英与服事城市穷人之间有着紧密的联系。

首先，城市教会对穷人的服事将成为其真实性的重要标志。正如圣经所说，这正是那些能让外邦人荣耀神的“好行为”（参见马太福音5:16；彼得前书2:12）。同样地，一旦文化精英归信基督，门训他们就包括要引导他们重新定位自己的财富和权力，用来帮助穷人和服事城市，而不是用在自己身上。换句话说，城市教会并不是在“服事穷人”和“服事专业阶层”之间做选择。我们需要文化精英的经济和文化资源来帮助穷人，而我们对穷人的委身，也正是对文化精英的一种见证，支持我们所传信息的真实性。

——我们可以有信心地断言，世界上的城市将继续在意义和权势上增长。正因为如此，城市仍旧具有战略意义，甚至比保罗和初代教会时代还要重要——那时的基督教宣教几乎完全是以城市为中心的。我要说：今日福音派教会最关键的任务之一，就是强调并支持城市事工。

需求极大，而代价同样不小——按人均计算，在城市中心开展事工远比在非城市地区昂贵得多。但教会不能再忽视这个世界中所发生的深刻且不可逆转的变化。如果基督徒想要触及“未得之民”，我们就必须进入城市。要触及新兴的一代，我们必须进入城市。若要在文化塑造上为基督产生影响，我们必须进入城市。若要服事穷人，我们必须进入城市。

许多天性上不喜欢城市生活的人，必须学习亚伯拉罕的榜样。亚伯拉罕蒙召离开熟悉的文化，成为一个客旅，寻求那神所建造的城市（参见创世记12:1–4；希伯来书11:8–10）。当然，基督徒并不需要为了苦难而主动寻求苦难，但我们是否也能效法道成肉身的基督？他并没有选择住在舒适之地，而是去到最有用的地方（参见马太福音8:20；约翰福音4:34；罗马书15:3）。我们是否也能因着他去面对困难（参见希伯来书11:26），接纳城市生活中的艰辛与丰盛？

Paul and other Christian missionaries went to great cities because when Christianity was planted there, it spread regionally (cities were the centers of transportation routes); it also spread globally (cities were multiethnic, international centers, and converts took the gospel back to their homeland); and finally it more readily affected the culture (the centers of learning, law, and government were in the cities). As we will see in this chapter, the importance of cities for Christian mission today is, if anything, even greater.

Today, cities are more important than ever before. In 1950, New York and London were the only world cities with metro-area populations of over ten million people. Today, however, thereare more than twenty such cities - twelve of which achieved that ranking in the last two decades - with many more to come.¹ All of these new megacities are developing in what was once called the Third World. But why?

In the eighteenth century, a combination of population growth and technology brought rural Europe to its "carrying capacity," creating a surplus population. Virtually all of the land was owned and developed, and so every family had some members who left the family farm, the countryside, and the small towns to make a living elsewhere. As a result, the great cities of Europe (and, in the nineteenth century, America) swelled in size. Many experts now believe that this type of shift has begun to occur in Africa, in Asia, and to a lesser extent in Latin America, where cities are exploding with people from the rural areas. If the urban-to-rural ratio of these populations stabilizes near 75 percent to 25 percent, as it did in Europe and North America, the next three decades will see over half a billion people move into the cities of Africa and Asia alone — in other words, one new Rio de Janeiro (ten million people) every two months.2 Currently, Western cities such as New York City grow at approximately 125,000 people per year, but cities such as Dhaka and Lagos are growing at a rate of more than half a million per year. By most estimates, we have reached the point where over 50 percent of the world population now lives in cities, compared to around 5 percent two centuries ago.3

## GLOBALIZATION AND RENAISSANCE
The significance of cities today lies not only in their growing size but also in their growing influence, and this influence is due to the rise of globalization. The technological revolution has led to an unprecedented mobility of people, ideas, and capital. Because of the Internet and other forms of electronic communication, people around the world are more connected than ever before,
and Western urban values in particular are spreading everywhere.

What is the effect of this "flattening" of the world due to globalization?4 First, globalization connects cities to the world. Some people predicted that the rise of technology would end up weakening cities, that it would make agglomeration (a cluster of usually disparate elements) obsolete.5 Social networking and communication online, it was argued, would make it unnecessary to pay the high costs of living in the city. But as Edwin Heathcote has written, "Digital networking has not, as was forecast, led to a decline in the city. Rather, it has led to an urbanization of the rest of the planet."6 People, especially young people, want to live in cities. The rise of new forms of technology and mobility has not weakened this desire. Instead, it has
dramatically expanded the reach and influence of urban culture. This urbanizing influence now extends far beyond the city limits, affecting even the most rural areas of remote countries.
Children in Mexico and Romania are becoming more like young adults in Los Angeles and New York City than the adults in their own locales.

Second, globalization connects cities to cities. Not only does globalization connect the rest of the world to urban ideas and culture; it also connects cities to one another, enhancing their
power and influence. World cities are more connected to others around the world than they are to their own nations. The elites of New York, London, and Tokyo not only work for the same
multinational companies, but they also graduate from common educational institutions, take vacations and buy homes in the same places, and share common social and cultural values. They
are better able to identify with the urban elites of other nations than with the nonurban citizens of their own countries.

The strong connections among major cities exist not only through the elites, however. Huge, diverse immigrant populations in global cities tie each urban area tightly to scores of other
countries. They travel frequently and communicate daily with their homelands. This means, for example, that thousands of residents of New York City are in much closer communication with
people in Athens, Manila, Port-au-Prince, Bogota, Hong Kong, and Lagos than they are with the residents of New Jersey and Connecticut. Each global city is a portal to others.

These networked world cities are quickly becoming more economically and culturally powerful than their own national governments. Governments are increasingly losing control of the
flow of capital and information and have far less influence than the multinational corporations and international financial, social, and technological networks based in global cities. According
to the American journalist Neal Peirce, "Great metropolitan regions — not cities, not states, not even the nation states — are starting to emerge as the world's most influential players."8

Cities not only grow and mature, but they can also be reborn. Despite the pessimism about Western cities during the late twentieth century, many have regenerated during the 1990s
and the first decade of the twenty-first century. During the twenty years from 1970 to 1990, many American cities went into sharp decline. Immigration of blacks from the South to northern
cities resulted in white flight, and many poor people were trapped in inner-city ghettos. In the late 1970s and early 1980s protracted recessions diminished tax revenues and drove some
cities near or into actual bankruptcy. Meanwhile, urban planning in the mid-twentieth century privileged the suburbs. Whole urban neighborhoods were bulldozed to create expressways that
gave suburban residents easy access to center-city jobs. Planners also favored big stores and stadiums with lots of parking, as well as massive housing projects for the poor. All of this led to
downtown urban centers that were like ghost towns after dark. The middle class flight to the suburbs took many jobs, leaving the poor poorer and most neighborhoods riddled with crime.
Cities hollowed out into "doughnuts," with poor nonwhite centers and affluent white suburbs.

However, since 1990, American cities have experienced an amazing renaissance.2 During this time, many cities' population declines have begun to reverse. People began to move back
into cities, and center cities began to regenerate at their cores. Why? One of the primary reasons is that during this time the U.S. economy experienced a sustained period of growth, which
created a great deal of new wealth and new jobs in knowledge sectors. Second, crime went down in cities for the reasons liberals cite (more jobs) and for the reasons conservatives cite (tougher
enforcement). Third, a cultural mood developed (which some call postmodern) embracing eclecticism, the mixture of the old and new, asymmetry, messiness and unmanageability, cultural
diversity, and the artistic and organic. All of these are features of city life rather than of suburban culture. Younger adults began to prefer city life and started moving to urban areas in greater
numbers. Fourth, changes in immigration law opened the door to an influx of immigrants from non-European nations. Between 1965 and 1970, U.S. immigration doubled. Then, from 1970 to
1990 it doubled again. Most of this immigration wave emptied into America's cities, renewing and diversifying many neighborhoods. It also completely changed the older, gridlocked, binary
black-white dynamic of urban politics into a far more complex, multipolar situation, with many ethnicities and nationalities.

> **COMEBACK: MINNEAPOLIS AND MILAN**  
> Edward Glaeser cites Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Milan, Italy, as cities that have reinvented themselves. Between 1950 and 1980, Minneapolis lost 30 percent of its population, and its location and climate hardly made it a great candidate for urban renaissance. Its older way of attracting human capital - touting its riverside location- was no longer of much appeal. Yet since 1980, the population of Minneapolis has continued to grow, and it now has the highest per capita income in the upper Midwest. Why? Minneapolis has reinvented itself as a center of education. It is home to the University of Minnesota, and "the city's most striking economic success stories have some link to
that school."10 One example is Medtronic, the world's largest medical technology company.
>
> Milan was a manufacturing giant that was hit by the same forces that led to the decline in the American Rust Belt. Its population fell almost 30 percent from 1970 through 2000. However, Milan reinvented itself, and today three-quarters of its workers are in services, especially finance, but also health and biotechnologies, telecommunications, and, of course, retail and fashion. The population has continued to grow over the past decade.11

As a result, many American cities began to surge. Professionals streamed into center-city neighborhoods, while new ethnic communities developed within older working-class and poor
neighborhoods. Sometimes the gentrification process was more destructive and disruptive to the social fabric; in other cases it had a more wholesome effect. The major actors in this renewed
upsurge included empty-nester boomers returning to cities, young professionals seeking cities to live and work in, and a wave of immigrants in inner-city neighborhoods and inner suburbs
that eventually produced second-generation college graduates who moved into the center city to live and work. These groups joined the gays and artists who have always chosen to live in urban
communities.12

Edward Glaeser points out that not all cities have succeeded in the past generation — and he points to Detroit, Michigan, and Leipzig, Germany, as examples. But most cities have found
the power to reinvent themselves, argues Glaeser, because the essence of what makes a city a city is the bringing of people together to innovate. At one level, this means bringing together the
most highly trained and talented people, the "elites." Yet at another level, it means bringing together the most energetic, ambitious, and risk-taking people from among the poor and middle
classes of the world. Cities are cauldrons of reengineering and reinvention, and so it should not surprise us to find that they are always reinventing themselves.

Perhaps the most interesting example of contemporary urban reinvention is what has been called the "consumer city." The post-World War II years brought about the rise of
suburbanization and the creation of the commuter city. People chose suburban life for its amenities and comforts and commuted into the city only for work and the occasional show. But
Vancouver and Los Angeles are two urban areas that reversed the trend. They became consumer cities marked by a new phenomenon - the reverse commuter. Increasingly, these and other
cities offer residents a quality of life they could not find elsewhere in the region — a dizzying variety of artistic, educational, cultural, and entertainment events and venues, but also (now) safe
streets, good schools, and excellent public transportation. Many people now move to London, New York, and Paris and are willing to pay a premium to live in the center of the city, even if their
jobs take them out of the core of the city each day.13

## THE FUTURE OF CITIES
Few people now believe we will see a significant decline in the population growth and importance of global cities, at least in the foreseeable future. The growth trends and culture shifts are on
too strong a trajectory. However, the Great Recession and hard economic times in the United States and Europe mean that city governments in these countries are being forced to make deep,
painful cuts to their budgets, while the private sector faces the prospect of years of high unemployment. The gaps in social service offerings are likely to widen in many cities. These changes
will certainly have an impact on the quality of life in cities. 14

So will Western cities return to the economic and population decline they experienced in the 1970s and 1980s? Several trends are likely to help many cities in the West continue
flourishing, at least for the foreseeable future. First, the world will continue to globalize — and globalization is a boon to cities that connect to it. More cities will imitate the biggest and most
established cities in the West - New York, Los Angeles, and London - whose strong international connections and influences will help to keep real estate values up and provide a constant
source of jobs (regardless of how national economies are faring). As a result, most globalizing cities should be able to remain economically stable.

Second, current urban planning in Western cities has returned to the classic urban form — compact, public transit-oriented, and walkable, mixed-use development (with residences,
businesses, retail outlets, educational and cultural institutions, and entertainment venues situated together). The emphasis will be on developing neighborhood schools, "complete" streets
with sidewalks for pedestrians, and lanes for bicyclists. This renewed emphasis on older forms is sometimes called "New Urbanism" or "Smart Growth," and there are many factors driving this
trend. One relates to environmental concerns. Suburban and rural dwellers consume far more energy — electricity, fossil fuels, and other forms — than urban residents.15 The increasingly
urgent search for energy sustainability will continue to press societies to urbanize. Cities, therefore, will remain a very attractive alternative to the suburbs as a social arrangement.

Third, immigration laws have not significantly changed (as of this writing), and so it is likely that the United States will continue to receive immigrants from around the world. Though
some trends have seen immigrants moving straight into the suburbs, the structure of city life continues to provide most new immigrants with the essential support resources they need to
successfully transition into a new society. Cities today will compete for immigrants, knowing that the urban areas that receive the most immigration will be best positioned for future success.

> **THERE REALLY IS NO CHOICE**  
> Al Mohler, president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, read the 2010 Special Report by Financial Times titled "The Future of Cities" and responded with strong language:
>
> This much is clear the cities are where the people are. In the course of less than 300 years, our world will have shifted from one in which only 3 percent of people
live in cities, to one in which 80 percent are resident in urban areas.
>
> If the Christian church does not learn new modes of urban ministry, we will find ourselves on the outside looking in. The Gospel of Jesus Christ must call a new generation of committed Christians into these teeming cities. As these new numbers make clear, there really is no choice. 16

Fourth, one of the greatest fears about cities - that high, life-threatening crime is inevitable in very large urban areas — is fast eroding. Led by New York City, many cities in North
America have seen startling drops in crime over the past two decades; and this is one of the main drivers of economic and population growth in cities. The decline in crime is often
attributed entirely to better police practices, as Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York recently claimed.17 But criminologists have shown that policing can only account for part of the
decline, and that crime only falls off drastically when a variety of factors converge, many of which are impossible to measure directly.18 These may include the strengthening of "civil society"
- in the flourishing of voluntary associations such as stronger parent-teacher alliances, growth in religious institutions, growth in various nonprofit agencies, and greater public-private
cooperatives. 19

Fifth, as far as I can tell, the postmodern mood that leads many young adults to prefer city life to suburban life will continue. This trend is difficult to quantify or fully explain, but the
appeal of city life for young people remains quite strong, and the presence of youthful energy and creativity will continue to sustain the growth and strength of cities. According to the Wall
Street Journal and The Atlantic, approximately 32 percent of Americans in the Millennial generation live in cities — and 88 percent of them want to.20

Some of the most troubled cities, such as Detroit, will need to make drastic changes, shrinking their urban footprint and redesigning into smaller municipalities. But this is unlikely to
become the norm in the United States. I believe globalization and the current cultural mood will continue to make cities highly desirable destinations for ambitious and innovative people, and
this will be a decisive factor in continuing the growth and dominance of urban culture.

Now, more than ever, cities set the course of society and life as a whole, even in areas of the world, such as Europe and North America, where cities are not growing as rapidly.21 All current
signs lead us to believe that the world order of the twenty-first century will be global, multicultural, and urban.

## THE CHALLENGE OF MINISTRY IN CITIES
The massive growth and influence of cities in our time confront Christian mission with an enormous challenge. The first problem is one of sheer scale and economics. It is critical that we have
Christians and churches wherever there are people, but the people of the world are now moving into the great cities of the world many times faster than the church is. Christian communication
and ministry must always be translated into every new language and context, but the Christian church is not responding fast enough to keep up with the rapid population growth in cities.

There are five million new people moving into the cities of the developing world every month — roughly the size of the metropolitan areas of Philadelphia or San Francisco. Think of
that - how many churches ought there to be in a city the size of Philadelphia? Even if there were one church for every five thousand people — which is five times fewer than the United States
average22 - this means we should be planting a thousand urban churches in the world every month.

But the challenge is not just numerical; it is also conceptual and methodological. Our very models for ministry must become increasingly urbanized. U.S. missions agencies are finding
that more and more they must send their workers to live and minister in the growing cities. But seldom are these Americans experienced at life or ministry in the city. A couple of years ago,
I met with American missionaries who had been sent to one of the fast-growing megacities of China. They told me their mission agency had assumed that the training they needed had to
do with learning the language and understanding Chinese culture. But after a while they realized they knew nothing about living in cities. Each member of their team had grown up in small
towns in southern and midwestern areas of the United States. They struggled more with urban life than with life in China per se. And they also came to see that the people they were trying
to reach were more like people living in Los Angeles and Manhattan than like those in the Chinese countryside. The leader of the team told me, "Only the language training we received was
helpful. We were given no training in how to live in cities and how to reach urban people, and as a result we've been ineffective."

Urbanization is not only transforming how we in the West do mission overseas; it is also transforming the mission landscape in the West itself. Waves of immigration from the Southern
and Eastern Hemispheres are coming to the cities of North America and Europe. Many of these immigrants come from parts of the world where belief in orthodox, supernatural Christianity
is on the rise. As a result, thousands of new churches are being planted by non-Westerners in the formerly secular cities of London, Paris, and New York.23 In fact, most of the largest, well-
attended churches in London and Paris are led by Africans, and in New York City we have seen hundreds of new churches started by Christians from Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and
Africa. At first, these new Christian churches remain somewhat isolated from the broader society, evangelizing and growing within ethnic enclaves. But as the children of these Christians
become educated in national universities and move into the center city, they will begin to wield greater power and influence in areas of finance, media, and culture. Anglo elites have begun
inviting many of these young nonwhites into the upper echelons of business and government, not realizing that a large percentage of them are Christians.24

Globalization and urbanization are removing the very distinction between "home" and "foreign" missions (to use, for a moment, the old terminology).25 Consider the example of a church
I know in the borough of Queens in New York City. This church has planted three daughter churches - one in New York's neighboring College Point, one in New York's neighboring Bronx, and
one in the "neighboring" Philippines. They had reached so many Filipino immigrants in their own neighborhood that these new Christians wanted to plant a daughter church among their
friends and relatives in their country of origin. So they sent a large group of people out from New York City to plant a new church. This is not an isolated case. Every major city is now a portal
for reaching the nations of the world. In other words, one of the very best ways to reach the far parts of the world is to reach your own city!26

Now consider another example. We planted Redeemer Presbyterian Church in the middle of New York City — in central Manhattan. Within a few years, we had planted daughter
churches in Westchester County, New York, and New Jersey (the two principal "bedroom communities" of the city). If we had originally located in any particular suburb, however, we would
never have been able in so short a time to plant churches in Manhattan or in the other suburbs. Why not? You can't reach the city from the suburbs, but you can reach the suburbs from the city.
Cities are like a giant heart-drawing people in and then sending them out. Students come to cities to attend school, and then they graduate and move out. Singles meet in the city, get married,
and move out to the suburbs when children are born. Immigrants come to the city and live in ethnic enclaves, but as they amass assets and become more established in their new country, they
move outward to gain additional space for their growing families. In each case, the movement is from the center outward. As a result, a church that thrives in the city will create a community
whose members will spread naturally throughout the adjoining region and into other great cities. In other words, one of the best ways to reach a region and country is to reach your own city!

> **ONE OF HISTORY'S GREATEST OPPORTUNITIES**  
> Cities can have a major impact on reaching hard-to-reach peoples with the gospel. This is the belief of missionary-theologian Roger Greenway:
>
> It may be helpful to those who harbor misgivings about cities... to reflect on the fact that urbanization as a present fact of life for most of the human family is a reality under the providential control of God. In Acts 17:26-27, the apostle Paul observes, "He determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. God did this so men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him." Viewed in light of these verses, city growth is not something to be perceived as entirely the work of the devil, but as part of God's providential plan in history. God's redemptive purpose behind urban growth is that "men should seek him and reach out for him"...
>
> Pressed together in metropolises, the races, tribes, and diverse people groups are geographically more accessible than ever before. In some cases the processes of change that new urbanites pass through make them more receptive to the gospel. If this is the case, world urbanization should be viewed in an eschatological as well as missionary framework. God in our time is moving climactically through a variety of social, political, and economic factors to bring earth's peoples into closer contact with one another, into greater interaction and interdependence, and into earshot of the gospel. By this movement God carries forward his redemptive purposes in history. A sign of our time is the city. Through worldwide migration to the city God may be setting the stage for Christian mission's greatest and perhaps final hour.27

## THE OPPORTUNITY OF MINISTRY IN CITIES
The growth in size and influence of cities today presents the greatest possible challenge for the church. Never before has it been so important to learn how to do effective ministry in cities, and
yet, by and large, evangelical Christianity in the United States is still nonurban.

Along with these challenges comes a range of unique opportunities. I see four important groups of people who must be reached to fulfill the mission of the church, and each of them can
best be reached in the cities.  
1. The younger generation. The prospects for advancement, the climate of constant innovation and change, the coming together of diverse influences and people — all of these appeal
to young adults. In the United States and Europe, the young disproportionately want to live in cities, and for the highly ambitious, the numbers are even higher. In a New York Times op-ed
column, "I Dream of Denver," David Brooks looks at Pew Research Center data that shows the sharp difference between younger Americans and older Americans as to their preference for cities:  
- _Cities remain attractive to the young. Forty-five percent of Americans between the ages of eighteen and thirty-four would like to live in New York City. But cities are profoundly unattractive
to people with families and to the elderly. Only 14 percent of Americans thirty-five and older are interested in living in New York City. Only 8 percent of people over sixty-five are drawn to
Los Angeles, 28_

This means, of course, that if the church in the West remains, for the most part, in the suburbs of Middle America and neglects the great cities, it risks losing an entire generation of
American society's leaders.

One of the reasons cities are filled with young adults is that they are also usually filled with students. In university towns it is obvious to the casual observer that students are an
important part of the demographic. In large cities, however, there are often enormous numbers of undergraduate and graduate students, but the size and diversity of the urban population
make college students less visible. Yet students constitute an extremely important mission field, and urban students have far more local job opportunities available to them after graduation
than do those who go to school in "college towns." As a result, college students in cities who are won to the faith are a significant source of future leaders for urban churches.

2. The "cultural elites." The second group is made up of those who have a disproportionate influence on how human life is lived in a society because they exert power in business,
publishing, the media, the academy, and the arts. These people live or spend much of their time in city centers. Since cities now influence the culture and values of the world more than ever, the
single most effective way for Christians to influence the culture of a nation is to have large numbers of them stay in cities and simply "be the church" there. Also, for all the reasons noted above,
ministry that is effective in a world city travels well. Ministry in rural areas of a country may have little transferability to rural areas in other countries. But ministry forms that are effective in
one center city are likely to have wide appeal to other center cities, especially with the younger generation.

Some Christians may complain, "We are losing the culture wars." This comment comes from the fact that relatively small groups living disproportionately in cities exert far more cultural
influence than evangelical Christians, who live disproportionately outside of cities. Every time I exit the 42nd Street subway station in Manhattan, I pass Viacom, the parent company of MTV.
Few institutions have had a greater cultural impact on an entire generation than MTV. I once read that years of Communist rule had not been able to erode the distinct ethnic identity of the
Hungarian minority in Romania. Now, however, a global youth culture is turning Hungarian youth away from their cultural roots. Global consumer youth culture is pumped from Manhattan
and Hollywood into the digital devices of kids all around the world. Fifteen-year-olds in rural Mexico are now more "urban" in their sensibilities than their parents are. If churches are to have
any influence on the people who create institutions like MTV, they will have to live and minister in the same places where these people live — in the city.

3. Accessible "unreached" people groups. Many people speak about the importance of engaging in mission to the hard-to-reach religious and cultural groups, people who live in remote
places or in nations that forbid Christian mission work. But the currents of history are now sweeping many of these formerly unreachable people into cities as rural economies fail to sustain
old ways of life.

Millions of these newcomers in the burgeoning cities of the world are more open to the Christian faith than they were in their original context. Most have been uprooted from their
familiar, traditional setting and have left behind the thicker kinship and tribal networks they once relied on, and most cities in the developing world often have "next to nothing in working
government services."29 These newcomers need help and support to face the moral, economic, emotional, and spiritual pressures of city life, and this is an opportunity for the church to serve
them with supportive community, a new spiritual family, and a liberating gospel message. Immigrants to urban areas have many reasons to begin attending churches, reasons that they did
not have in their former, rural settings. "Rich pickings await any groups who can meet these needs of these new urbanites, anyone who can at once feed the body and nourish the soul."31

But there is yet another way in which cities make formerly hard-to-reach peoples accessible. As I noted earlier, the urban mentality is spreading around the world as technology connects
young generations to urbanized, global hyperculture. Many young people, even those living in remote places, are becoming globalized semi-Westerners, while their parents remain rooted in
traditional ways of thinking. And so ministry and gospel communications that connect well with urban residents are also increasingly relevant and effective with young nonurban dwellers.

> **MOVING TO THE CITY**  
> In Two Cities, Two Loves, James Montgomery Boice considered the 10 percent ratio given in Nehemiah 11:1 for repopulating Jerusalem and suggested that in America, which is less agricultural, a proportional ratio should be even higher. His point was that if more of the nation's Christians deliberately moved into the largest cities and there lived out a life of love, truth, and servanthood, the culture would be fundamentally changed.30

4. The poor. A fourth group of people who can and must be reached in cities is the poor. Some have estimated that one-third of the people representing the new growth in cities in the
developing world will live in shantytowns. A great majority of the world's poor live in cities, and there is an important connection between reaching the urban elites and serving the poor of
your city. First, an urban church's work among the poor will be a significant mark of its validity. It is one of the "good deeds" that Scripture says will lead pagans to glorify God (Matt 5:16; 1 Pet
2:12). Similarly, once cultural elites are won to Christ, discipling them includes reorienting them to spend their wealth and power on the needs of the poor and the city instead of on themselves.
In other words, an urban church does not choose between ministry to the poor and ministry to the professional class. We need the economic and cultural resources of the elites to help the poor,
and our commitment to the poor is a testimony to the cultural elites, supporting the validity of our message.
---
We can be confident that the cities of the world will continue to grow in significance and power. Because of this, they remain just as strategic - if not more so-than they were in the
days of Paul and the early church when Christian mission was predominantly urban. I would argue that there is nothing more critical for the evangelical church today than to emphasize and
support urban ministry.

The need is great, as is the cost― ministry in city centers is considerably more expensive on a per capita basis than it is away from the urban core. But the church can no longer ignore the
profound and irreversible changes occurring in the world today. If Christians want to reach the unreached, we must go to the cities. To reach the rising generations, we must go to the cities. To
have any impact for Christ on the creation of culture, we must go to the cities. To serve the poor, we must go to the cities.

Many people who are not naturally comfortable in the city will have to follow the example of Abraham. Abraham was called to leave his familiar culture and become a pilgrim, seeking
the city of God (Gen 12:1-4; Heb 11:8–10). And while Christians should not deliberately seek difficulty for its own sake, can we not follow the example of the incarnate Christ, who did not live
in places where he was comfortable but went where he was useful (Matt 8:20; John 4:34; Rom 15:3)? Can we not face difficulty for his sake (cf. Heb 11:26), embracing both the difficulties and
the riches of city living?
