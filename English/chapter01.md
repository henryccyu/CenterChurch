# Chapter 1 THE GOSPEL IS NOT EVERYTHING
What do we mean by "the gospel"? Answering this question is a bit more complex than we often assume. Not everything the Bible teaches can be considered "the gospel" (although it can be
argued that all biblical doctrine is necessary background for understanding the gospel). The gospel is a message about how we have been rescued from peril. The very word gospel has as its
background a news report about some life-altering event that has already happened.1

**1. The gospel is good news, not good advice**. The gospel is not primarily a way of life. It is not something we do, but something that has been done for us and something that we must
respond to. In the Greek translation of the Old Testament - the Septuagint — the word euangelizo (proclaim good news) occurs twenty-three times. As we see in Psalm 40:9 (ESV) — "I have
told the glad news of [your] deliverance in the great congregation” — the term is generally used to declare the news of something that has happened to rescue and deliver people from peril. In
the New Testament, the word group euangelion (good news), euangelizo (proclaim good news), and euangelistes (one who proclaims good news) occurs at least 133 times. D. A. Carson draws this
conclusion from a thorough study of gospel words:
> Because the gospel is news, good news... it is to be announced; that is what one does with news. The essential heraldic element in preaching is bound up with the fact that the core message
is not a code of ethics to be debated, still less a list of aphorisms to be admired and pondered, and certainly not a systematic theology to be outlined and schematized. Though it properly
grounds ethics, aphorisms, and systematics, it is none of these three: it is news, good news, and therefore must be publicly announced².

**2. The gospel is good news announcing that we have been rescued or saved**. And what are we rescued from? What peril are we saved from? A look at the gospel words in the New
Testament shows that we are rescued from the "coming wrath" at the end of history (1 Thess 1:10). But this wrath is not an impersonal force - it is God's wrath. We are out of fellowship with
God; our relationship with him is broken.

In perhaps the most thoroughgoing exposition of the gospel in the Bible, Paul identifies God's wrath as the great problem of the human condition (Rom 1:18 - 32). Here we see that the
wrath of God has many ramifications. The background text is Genesis 3:17-19, in which God's curse lies on the entire created order because of human sin. Because we are alienated from God,
we are psychologically alienated within ourselves - we experience shame and fear (Gen 3:10). Because we are alienated from God, we are also socially alienated from one another (v. 7 describes
how Adam and Eve must put on clothing, and v. 16 speaks of alienation between the genders; also notice the blame shifting in their dialogue with God in vv. 11-13). Because we are alienated
from God, we are also physically alienated from nature itself. We now experience sorrow, painful toil, physical degeneration, and death (vv. 16-19). In fact, the ground itself is "cursed" (v. 17;
see Rom 8:18-25).

Since the garden, we live in a world filled with suffering, disease, poverty, racism, natural disasters, war, aging, and death — and it all stems from the wrath and curse of God on the world.
The world is out of joint, and we need to be rescued. But the root of our problem is not these "horizontal" relationships, though they are often the most obvious; it is our "vertical" relationship
with God. All human problems are ultimately symptoms, and our separation from God is the cause. The reason for all the misery - all the effects of the curse - is that we are not reconciled to
God. We see this in such texts as Romans 5:8 and 2 Corinthians 5:20. Therefore, the first and primary focus of any real rescue of the human race the main thing that will save us - is to have
our relationship with God put right again.

**3. The gospel is news about what has been done by Jesus Christ to put right our relationship with God**. Becoming a Christian is about a change of status. First John 3:14 (emphasis
added) states that "we have passed from death to life," not we are passing from death to life. You are either in Christ or you are not; you are either pardoned and accepted or you are not; you
either have eternal life or you don't. This is why Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones often used a diagnostic question to determine a person's spiritual understanding and condition. He would ask, “Are you
now ready to say that you are a Christian?" He recounts that over the years, whenever he would ask the question, people would often hesitate and then say, "I do not feel that I am good enough."
To that, he gives this response:
